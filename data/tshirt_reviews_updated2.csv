  Never was a fan of Fruit of the Loom, but these tee shirts changed my opinion. I am 6’6” and have a very hard time finding shirts long enough. I was always a Jockey fan, but price and poor reviews lead me to check other brands. The amazon reviews for Fruit of the Loom were really good so I ordered a 3 pack of 3x long, a size larger than usual. Should have stuck with the 2x long, but very happy with my purchase. Extremely high quality, very long, and a terrific price, (around $4.00 per shirt).. order some, you won’t regret it.

  I'm 6'3"" 215 lbs with about a 37"" waist. The XL have been fine.  I really like longer shirts that stay tucked in at work instead of bunching up under my dress shirt.  I've ordered Jockey shirts that were way more expensive but were obviously better quality material when comparing side by side.  But since it's just an under shirt, these are perfect.  They do shrink up A LOT.  I ordered a second pack and compared one to a shirt I had been washing/wearing and there was a difference of several inches in length, at least an inch in sleeve, and probably a couple inches in chest.  So when you open the pack, keep that in mind.  They start out huge but shrink down when washed.

  These shirts are nice and long, fit well and a great price. A few weeks ago i purchased another brands (starts with H) A-shirts which were 3 for $20. Those were ""tall"" shirts and are pretty decent, but pretty pricey. I found these shirts at 3 for $10 and I am quite pleased to report that they are just as long as the other brand and fit just as well. The only reason I docked one star is because of the unfinished bottom of the shirt, which is negligible because these shirts typically get tucked in, but it might be a problem for the longevity of the shirt. Only time will tell if that becomes a problem, but for this price and the fact that these are really long (I'm 6'8"" tall) I am very satisfied!

  My husband is 6'1"" and these hang down past his groin area. Way too long.  They are pretty thin but that's not an issue. I washed them and they came out with a pink hue, weird as they were the only thing in the wash. So I washed them again and dumped Clorox in the machine. They aren't as pink, doable. But overall I wouldn't order these again, they are just too long.  They'll be too warm for summer, so much material. They fit like a tall instead of a big.

  Bought 2 packs of the 3XB last year and loved them! I am over 6'1"", 310lbs, and lift weights. These t-shirts fit very well around the neck, chest, and armpit areas, and was a bit extra long to boot. At only $15 a pack, it was an excellent and satisfying purchase. They've held up great, but used them for so many occasions that I made them a bit dingy - not a product fault at all. I decided to repeat the order to get some refreshed shirts, but the price per pack is now almost $40 EACH! What a total scam that kills the sale for me, because I refuse to pay over double the past price for the same product.  It's a shame because FOTL has a great t-shirt here.

  Bought these 2XBig Fruit of the Loom t-shirts for my husband via Subscribe and Save here. He's about 6' tall, 240 lb and I like the extra width, nice comfortable look and he likes he fit. Very thin t-shirts, definitely undershirts, decent value.<br/><br/>My main dislike is that the collars are so wide. They look stretched out from the start, making for a very sloppy look if exposed under a sweater or something.<br/><br/>We've since switched to the Gildan ones available here, 100% cotton, and a bit thicker. Those aren't as widely cut and need to be washed cold to resist losing length. They're so cheap though, we'll likely replace them more often, although they're a nicer quality t-shirt overall. These are okay, recommended if you want the extra sizing. Hope this helps! Smile.

  So let me first state that these briefs are some of the most comfortable ones I’ve got from Fruit of the Loom.  I’ve originally bought 4 packs and 2-3 weeks later got an additional 4 packs. I’ve been buying Fruit of the Looms for many of years (I’m 48).  The fit great, don’t shift around and stay put throughout the day.  However the quality of these briefs is terrible.  Within 2-3 washes the in seams are ripping apart.  I already had to through away 6 pairs (that’s a total of 2 of the packages).  I have serious doubts the remaining briefs are going to last the next 3 months.  I believe these may be my last Fruit of the Loom products if that’s how the quality is going to be going forward.  Not worth the price I’ve paid for them.

Burlap is cheaper and maybe softer.

<span>
  You know Big &amp; Tall stores? Well I’m both of those and finding tanks that don’t expose my bum crack is a chore.<br/>I bought these based on the (antiquated) notion the FoTL was good stuff. Not sure that is accurate anymore.<br/>Amusingly the packaging had a spot that said “feel the softness” but the packaging wasn’t cut out, so all you would feel was plastic. That should have been a clue. Well they weren’t soft when I opened them (mistake one).<br/>I tried it on and it was a little snug, but the length was good. After wondering how bad it could be and opening both packages I bought (mistake two), I washed them (mistake three). They shrank a bit and now they are even more rough feeling somehow. It’s like a tank top of white overly tight burlap that hugs you in all the wrong places. I half expect rug-burn-type rashes where these shirts hug and grind.<br/>And since I washed them, I can’t return them. Steer clear, oh reader, find something different!

  I purchased fruit of the loom shirts instead of Hanes based on several reviews here. I like lightweight men's v-necks for sleeping and around the house.  But I'm 5'7"" and even the XL's shrink to be too short in the length. So I ordered these FOTL tall XL's for the extra length. As expected, they shrunk overall down to a ""Large"" size after 1 wash &amp; dry. But they maintained enough length that they're good for a nightshirt. Exactly what I was looking for. They're a little heavier than Haynes but still very comfortable.

  Totally great white tshirt for a bigger guy. I am 6'1"" tall, weigh about 315lbs, and lift weights. This shirt fits perfectly around my neck and underarms, fine around the waist, and has the needed extra length to stay tucked in by itself or under an over shirt. After washing several times in hot water, they do the normal ""minor tightness"" when fresh out of the dryer, but then easily stretch back out with a gentle tug after putting back on. Each time, the neck stitching has maintained a nice collar around my neck, and is comfortable to wear in the house as a relaxed shirt, stay cool while outside grilling, and wear underneath other tshirts while exercising or household chores and sweating. Very good tshirt at a great price (under $20 for a pack of three).

  These are the absolute WORST undershirts that I have ever owned. Unfortunately, I was unaware of the wretched quality of the product until they were washed on several occasions.<br/><br/>I never use bleach on my shirts as it weakens the integrity of the fabric. Before I purchased these, the last brand of undershirt that I had war was made by Gildan. Before I purchased Gildan I purchased Fruit of the Loom because that's what I had before. I can honestly say that this was a regrettable purchase because Gildan produces a better product at a lower price.<br/><br/>I cannot return these undershirts and I have to continue to find holes in them as I continue to use them. This is the absolute last time that I will ever purchase undershirts made by Fruit of the Loom.

  My son is a very large fellow.  I got sick of seeing him in too-small undershirts (usually with holes in them).  I decided to look on Amazon and found Fruit of the Loom Big Man's shirts.  Wow!

He is so thrilled to find a shirt that not only fits well, and looks good on him but that he says feels ""so comfortable"".  I rarely get such rave reviews from him.

  This is my second time purchasing these t-shirts.. oh no they're not for my boyfriend or husband there for me! I love to wear t-shirts around the house that are big and baggy. These do not disappoint ! The material is very soft and they wash up beautifully. The only one thing I wish that Amazon would stop putting my packages in places to which I did not request. Like leaving my package by the mailbox when you're supposed to put the package at the customer door.. I live in a gated community but however that's not what I pay for in my prime membership.!! Oh yeah they've also thrown packages over the fence left them at the front gate on the bench we're in anybody could take things and people have.. but I digressed.. fruit of the loom has been around for a long time and they still crank out quality clothing.

  I ordered the size L Tall.  I am a woman who likes sleeping in big t shirts and my old ones were wearing out.  These are made a little cheaper. The hems are a little narrower than my other FTL shirts and they didn't wash it as softly as I would like.  Maybe a few more washings will help.  That being said, the quality is not bad.  There are no flaws in the construction, loose strings or anything.  They did shrink about  half a size so order up for the best fit.  (I washed in cold water and dried on med.)

Would fit MUCH better if the tank top undershirt arm holes were larger
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Being 6'2"" and 210 lbs with a 35"" waist, I have an athletic/rugby build and do a lot of weight training.  Before purchasing this 4XL Big Man fit size, I actually wore the 3XL A-shirt undershirt by Fruit of the Loom and as I was gaining muscle mass, arm holes were chaffing underneath my armpits.  I liked the design of the 3XL having thin straps and the larger arm holes that gave a greater range of motion.  The 3XL was excessively long in height, but I knew it's what came with such a big size.<br/><br/>When I purchased the 4XL Big Man fit size, I though it would resolve the arm hole problem, but it didn't at all!  The arm holes for this 4XL Big Man fit size was actually smaller than the 3XL!  The seller's picture is very misleading in displaying this.<br/><br/>Although these Big Man shirts give more width for the chest and rib cage, the smaller arm holes make these A-shirts more uncomfortable, and this very noticeable whenever I lie down or turn to the side while in bed.  I had to resort to cutting the side seam 5-6"" down from the arm holes to stop the chaffing to make these garments useful and comfortable to wear.  If anybody is having underarm chaffing with their undershirts with any smaller sizes, avoiding buying this Big Man design, because the underarm chaffing will not improve with these A-shirts (aka tank top undershirts).<br/><br/>Maybe the ""Tall Man"" selection would have resolved my problem, but after monitoring the availability for 1-2 months before purchasing, a ""4XL Big Tall "" size never appeared.

  Got the 5xl for my husband who is 6’5” and weights over 300lbs. They where a bit large but once washed they shrank a bit and looks like they’ll work perfect for him. I always struggle to find some that will fit not just in the waist but in the height as I want him to feel comfortable wearing something that covers everything. This ones work perfect would be buying more for him. So make sure you order a size bigger as this material shrinks over a wash but would definitely recommend them.

  These fit great, but know they will shrink.. I buy the tall size because the fruit of the loom undershirts always seem to shrink on me big time and I can no longer tuck them in. With the tall version, that is no longer an issue. They area really long at first, than after washing they are normal length. Way better than buying the normal ones than being too short for myself. I do on ocassion have issues hiding the v-neck collar under my shirt after its been work a bit. Maybe it's the other shirt above it that's the issue, I don't really know, but felt like I should bring it up just in case.

  A man becomes accustomed to a certain style and fit when it comes to underwear. Previous purchases have been wearing out (as expected; men are rough on undergarments, so no complaint to be had there).

  These were awesome! Took a bit to convince my honey that he needed to switch to a big and tall style (he is 6'3""). Tried explaining that the reason all his t-shirts would rip under the arm is because they were too short and he was tugging so hard on them to be able to tuck them in to his pants. I bought these and convinced him to try them. He is ecstatic! The underarms aren't ripping, they are extremely comfortable and he can not only tuck them in with ease...they stay tucked in.

  These aren't perfect, but darn good enough.  Especially when you factor in the price.  It's tough to find a true big and tall undershirt - many brand I've tried are way to short, or the sleeves are too long, or the neck holes stretches way too much, etc.  But these are just a good, basic undershirt with no major problems in my opinion.  This is the second time I purchased these and the only issue I've noticed is that one shirt in the first package seemed to be slightly smaller than the others.

  This is an update to my earlier review.  I forgot to include the size undershirt that I bought.<br/>It's listed as, LT 42-44 inches.<br/><br/>I'm a male, 5' 11"" tall.  Over the years I've had a difficult time finding white ""T"" shirts/undershirts that are long enough to stay tucked in.  I bought some of these undershirts and I'm VERY happy with them.  They are longer than most undershirts, and best of all, they stay tucked in.<br/>From the bottom of the crew neck edge to the bottom of the shirt is 27"".<br/>Even after a couple of washings, they still fit great.<br/>You won't be disappointed.

  I read a lot of reviews saying it was too snug. For all the bigger/taller guys out there that buy these ribbed shirts from Wal Mart like I do, I bought the size as I do there (2X) and it was the exact same size minus being about 3-6 inches longer. It definitely solved my issue of the under shirt not staying tucked in all day. It now takes an act of congress to become un-tucked for me.

  I'm 6'3"" with a long torso and was always complaining to my wife about how my undershirts would come untucked. It took me until I was 31 years old to realize that I needed the tall version of an undershirt. I'm an idiot for not realizing this was a thing for so long. Since my first purchase several weeks ago, I've ordered the pack of three twice more and am slowly replacing all of my old shirts. Its amazing how much more comfortable these things are when compared to having a shirt that is untucked. Do yourself a favor and try it out. At a minimum, you will get three new shirts that aren't grayed/yellowed and you should probably throw a few of the old ones out anyways.

Need Better Quality Control
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Really disappointed in Fruit of the Loom on these. I initially purchased two packs, and shortly after went back for a third. The packaging comes with black and grey colored briefs. All of the grey colored ones, within two wearings and washings, started coming apart on several seams. And different seams on each one. I've had to toss the grey ones, but I've had zero issues with the black ones. And they are very comfortable. I'm no expert in any way with regards to stitching or sewing, but it appeared there just wasn't enough overlap in the seam area for the stitches to hold. Again, I expected better from FotL. If all had performed the way the black ones did, this would be five stars.

  These T-shirts are great. First time I've bought clothing through Amazon and I am so pleased. Until now I have bought T-shirts through local department stores, same Fruit of the Loom brand, same size, but these are so much better quality, less expensive, and I didn't need to drive to the store or jostle with crowds in the aisles or at the checkout stand. The material is heavier and the length is just perfect. They did not shrink when I washed them. Before now, the length of T-shirts was inconsistent and often several T-shirts in a package were too short. And those from stores would shrink after I washed them. I could not be more pleased. I will definitely be buying my T-shirts through Amazon from now on.

  I'm tall but not particularly wide, and have had a lot of trouble finding undershirts that fit. I need long-body shirts, but I also want a deeper V-neck than many sold today and also want sleeves that don't peek out from under short-sleeved shirts. These undershirts aren't made of the most luxurious material, but they're quite acceptable and have a moderately deep V-neck, short enough sleeves and a long-enough body. They did shrink an inch or so after washing, which was ok, as the initial length was more than adequate.

(His exact words are, ""These are awesome - totally awesome!)<br/><br/>I washed them first, so apparently they didn't shrink (and if they did, he loves the after-washed length, so it's all good).<br/><br/>I gave them a 4 because like other reviewers say, they could be softer. However, I asked my husband if he cared (or noticed) and he said no. After an evening of wearing one under a dress shirt, he still thinks they are awesome.<br/><br/>You can't beat them for the price.

Great shirt before washing! Shrunk in cold water...
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  First let me start out by saying these shirts WERE great straight out of the package. I am 5’9” and like my shirts loose and long. Size wise I wear a 4x snugly, 5x loose, and 6x baggy. They fit big and were quite long before washing. After a single wash in cold water, and a tumble dry on low, they shrunk considerably in height and width. What was once a baggy shirt that went more than 2 inches below my waist is now a snug shirt that is ¼ an inch above my waist. The shirts now fit similar to a 4x in width, however lost about 4 inches in length. Due to the shrinkage I have taken off 2 stars for my review.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Price, purchased at $10 for a 3 pack.<br/>* Nice bright white color.<br/>* Color didn’t fade after 3 washes.<br/>* Thin material, not too thick. Great for an undershirt and to wear in the summer.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Shrunk considerably after a single wash in cold water with a tumble dry on low.<br/>* Material is a bit stiff and scratchy.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>I might purchase these again, if the price is the same, to use as backup undershirts. If you’re under 5’9” and a 4x shirt is baggy on you then get the 6x size and they’ll shrink to fit. If you wear a 5x or 6x normally then I’d suggest you stay away and put your money towards a shirt that doesn’t shrink and fits truer to size after washing.

I am not tall but all the other tees I have barely make it to my belt line. Not these. If these do not stay tucked in it is because you are 7 feet tall and wearing your gangsta' pants way too low.

I have gotten other brands that did not meet my expectations... but these are TOP notch.  I went ahead and ordered another set.  THANK YOU!<br/><br/>The FIT: Normally I order Large Tall because I like my undershirts tight under my dress shirts.  but the XL Tall after a HOT washing are just perfect!

The two pros for these shirts are that they do no shrink up on me and that they do not cost me an arm and a leg. I will disclaim though that when I wash and dry, I do not dry the shirts on a high heat, but a I utilize a low heat or air dry. It takes a bit longer, but it is worth it to reduce the risk of shrinkage. I am now looking at purchasing another package of these and looking for v-necks in the next 20 minutes.

  I originally ordered X-Large and had to return them and get XX-Large.  If you are like me and on the border of 2 sizes, go up to the larger size on these shirts.  The return and exchange was very easy with Amazon!  The shirts are about the right weight for me....not too heavy, but not real thin either.  Just a decent quality weight that is comfortable.  The shirts are quite long, which is exactly what I wanted.  No one should have any problem with these coming untucked.  Overall, I am very happy with the purchase, especially since I purchased them for an extremely low price from Amazon.

<span>
  These are really tall and I like em.  I am 6'5"" and they probably come down 8 inches below my waist.  But from experience, stuff shrinks for a full year, so these are really solid for a tall guy and will be even better once they shrink-in a bit.  Vs. the equivalent Hanes brand, similar quality of cotton it seems.  I prefer the neckline on the Hanes more.  It seems more natural.  The pro on these is they are longer.  I am 44 on shoulders and went a size up to the XLT.  I recommend that because they will shrink some over time I am sure.

  I had to go through quite a few shirts before I found these. The length of undershirts is critical to comfort. Other shirts are too short and will shrink to an even shorter length. I hate the feeling of an undershirt getting un tucked. Other shirts feel like your pants are full of shirt.  A good undershirt should be about the same length as the shirt being tucked in. These shirts are that length and don't shrink. The v neck is also great. For those unaware, the current business casual dress is to wear a bottom up shirt with the top bottom open and a v neck. I don't want to see any of you gentlemen with a crew neck even if you have overgrown chest hair.

  If you are an XL and have ANY XXL shirts in your closet or have thought, ""My XL shirts are tighter than they used to be"", go for the XXL.  The shirt fits great before washing but after washing, it fits like a glove - tight.  If you like that feeling, go with XL.  If you like for your undershirts to have a little breathing room, go for the XXL.  Other than that, the Tall shirt is good and longer than standard shirts - but length also shrinks some after washing.

  Great product.  My husband loves colored V-necks tees for everyday wear.  It is impossible to find those that are affordable and don't shrink so much in length that they show his belly in size large.  These size LT were perfect.  We purchased them twice and dyed them with some Rit so he had his colored V-neck Tees for the whole summer.  He loves them!!!!  We only wish they had long sleeve V-neck tees that we could dye for fall and winter wear.

  As the description says, taller not bigger or wider. Somewhat though to my chagrin as the neck opening is quite small and tight. Also tight against my chest and abdomen. Yes I'm heavier, but not obese... I am 6'0"", have a 32"" inseam and weigh about 220 pounds. I found the length acceptable to my other tall size shirts. Best advice to other purchasers, if you are thin and wiry, you'll probably love these shirts. If you are heavier, order up one size larger. IMO, they'd be a perfect fit for me if I'd gotten on size up from what I normally wear.

  I bought these tees for my son who is 6'6"" and 170 pounds - so, very skinny.  After one wash, they were about as long as a standard (not tall size) dress shirt, and shrunk a little more in the second wash.  These tees are a good choice for someone who is very tall but not too beefy - and that's a hard bill to fill.

The shirts I'm reviewing here are longer than normal, the size in the shoulders about the same, but the material is much lighter weight and about 3"" shorter. The length however is still good for wearing tucked in while a sweater remains untucked, or a long sleeve shirt worn the same way...so good purchase, but I will keep looking for the extra long ones I really wanted.

  Thank goodness more undershirts are being made in tall sizes. They don't come untucked and bunch up at your belt, and they do the job of being an undershirt. Be realistic with yourself: your white undershirts will turn gray or yellow over time. You can wash them in different ways to maybe get a little more time out of them, but if you wear them once a week, just plan on replacing them every once in a while. The old ones can be rags of various sorts, or whatever.

We've found it quite difficult to find A shirts made for larger men in dept stores! Thanks Amazon!!

  I'm a fat guy, about 5'11 and 300 pounds. I hate white undershirts that come untucked all the time, and these shirts completely eliminate that issue. They are long on me, really long. The probably go down about mid-thigh. After washing and drying they shrink some, but that's fine, because they are so long that even with shrinkage they are plenty long to do the job. They are also a little on the thin side, so they are cooler and more comfortable to wear for a fat, sweaty guy like me!

  Lets face it. I'm a bit chubby. So I like long t-shirts that stay tucked in.  These have good length and even with a few launderings, they have not shrunk and still have a great length.  I ordered 2 more packs as soon as I got these out of the dryer and found them to no lose length as so many other shirts have that I have tried.  Like I said, I ordered 2 more packs and will be a re-peat buyer of these.  At $3.32 a piece, they are way less expensive than the department store brand I was paying $11.00 each for on sale.  This is a keeper.

  I purchased these for my long-torsoed husband who always has a problem with his undershirts being too short and coming untucked. If we buy a standard undershirt (not the “long”), we have to buy up a size or two and then the shirts are far too wide and bunch up under his dress shirts. These are longer than the Hanes long shirts, and stay softer longer.

  The t-shirt was a great fit, and very comfortable, and soft after washing.  I wear this type of t-shirt under a dress shirt.  I order a tall version so it will be extra long and will stay tucked in as I move about during the day.  This is especially helpful as I am a little over weight and have a spare tire which can cause a normal length tee to pull out, especially as they get older and tend to shrink up a little

  These provided the extra length unneeded without extra ""size."" Now my undershirts stay tucked in preventing a bunch-up above my waist. They can sometimes cause a little bunch up around the pocket area, but not a problem and better than the alternative. Decent quality, not the softest or heaviest undershirt but far from the worse. Neck works well and stays below neckline of most shirts.

  Center back of one of the 3 shirts in the package measured 32"" long before machine washing and drying. One shirt came out of the dryer at 28.5"", one at 29"" and one at 30"".  Fabric is thin which might be fine if you want a lightweight T shirt, hems are narrow. Just-okay quality, not a good choice if you need a long/tall shirt that stays tucked in.

Not exactly ""V"" enough for me
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  The ""V"" in the V-neck is just a notch, hardly a ""V.""  You know why I wear ""V"" neck T-shirts? Because ""V"" stands for Victory.  That's right, I'm not dressing to go to work to lose. Nope, I want to go to work and stomp the living daylights out of my adversaries. I want Victory. Victory with an upper case, shouting ""V"" to begin my victory lap. And I want my T-shirt to reflect that attitude.<br/><br/>These shirts, on the other hand, are all about a lower case Pyrrhic victory. You know the kind of ""victory"" I'm talking about - the kind where you have to slink home and hope the neighbors didn't see you. The kind of victory that leaves your adversaries crying with laughter and asking you to please stop. No, it's worse that that - this ""v"" neck t-shirt is the kind of shirt where your adversaries call you up to tell you where you've hosed up and try to help you improve your performance.<br/><br/>And, in keeping with the overall theme that the shirt is for luuuusers, the fabric feels like a high grit sandpaper. But it's not all bad. The overall construction of shirt is quite good.  The stitching is tight and there are no loose ends on the shirts I received. The fabric looks like it will stand up to many washings.

  Great value. I ordered a 3 pack to test it out before ordering a few more. size 2XLT worked for me ((6'1"", 250lb). Washed and dried on high to get any shrinkage done, and it fit good, was plenty long. As others noted, length is great for wearing under a dress shirt so it doesn't get un-tucked and bunched up.

  Good quality at a good price. Fit is exactly as I needed. They seem to be decently constructed and they are a whole lot cheaper than some others - Kingsize, for example, were three times more. Maybe the quality is slightly better there, but not three times better. They're 10% cheaper than Haynes as well. So, good fit, good price, decent quality.

cost less than Jockey and it's clear why when you compare them
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  I have always worn Jockey but they haven't seemed as nice to me as they used to be and these were on sale and I gave them a shot. I haven't had them long enough to know how they wear, but they are significantly thinner than Jockey t-shirts. That may or may not be a positive for you but they seem cheap to me. Perhaps I'm being unfair, as they are indeed less expensive.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've now had these a year and I've worn them enough (or a few of them) so that if repeated washing could soften them, it would have happened by now. As I wrote above, at about $3/each they are cheap, but they're no deal. First, you can find Jockey's on sale for $6/each, which while twice as much, isn't much in absolute terms. And what I didn't notice right away is that these are called ""tall"" but they're not nearly as long as the Jockey version is.<br/><br/>The only positive thing I can think to say is that it's hard to find a tall medium and these are closer to that than the Jockey LT is. But they shrink in a way that Jockey's don't and the material difference is night and day.

  These fit great, and so far they are holding up quite nicely. If I had to come up with one criticism, I think the sleeves are a little short. Depending on whether you are wearing these as an undershirt or a normal shirt, that could be considered a positive or a negative, but if you want something with a longer/looser sleeve, grab the hanes. Otherwise, I couldn't recommend these more highly.

  Good quality with good fit and sewn properly at a good price.  Had to go back to Briefs because the FOL Boxers have seams that are sewn inside out and had to get rid of beaucoup pairs of them after a year or two.  They chafe and sad to say poorly made in the Orient or outside the USA as most of the worthless clothing is these day!  Union made was overall better in everywaqy!

  It was time to replace some 10 year old or so ""rags"" I was using that I guess you could still call undershirts if you squinted just right.  Yes I hate to shop for cloths and wear them till they fall apart, Ok my bad but it is what it is.  I took the plunge and purchased 1 three pack to see how they fit, WOW, very comfortable!  I ordered a larger size not knowing really what size I needed since the old undershirts I had where so stretched out of shape and found they are nice and roomy but a bit too roomy.<br/>I love that they are REALLY BIG MEN'S size, which are hard to find, but you might know that already.  The shirt hangs down to my thigh which means a lot of tucking but sure feel great to have something that isn't like wearing spandex lol.<br/>If your a big guy - grab some while you can.  Price is great compared to some online ""Big Men's"" sites that charge $15 or more just for 1 undershirt.<br/>Please keep these in stock!!

  It's so hard to find undershirts for my husband who is 6'3"".  The regular size shirts just seem to shrink up after a few washes and then never stay tucked in when he wears them.  Stores don't seem to sell Tall Size undershirts so I was extremely pleased to find these online.  My husband likes that they are longer and stay tucked in!

they are a much better fit the current crop of ""regular length"" t-shirts
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  It appears that, in order to save money, some brands have shortened the length of their T-Shirt.  Now, at 5'7"", I have to buy a tall.  If you have really old Fruit of the Loom (my older ones are 10+ years), these are just slightly longer.  However, they are a much better fit the current crop of ""regular length"" t-shirts.  The length is about perfect but they are not very soft (800 grit sandpaper comes to mind).  Also, I wish it was available in a medium, rather than starting at large.<br/><br/>Hanes makes a Tall that is soft AND also the right length BUT the V is not quite deep enough.  Thus, if you use it as and undershirt, the Hanes shirt usually shows.  I have also tried upsizing the regular shirts in various brands but always wind up with something more wide than long.<br/><br/>I guess I can live with the coarseness to get the right size.  I'm just wondering what tall people use now.

  These t-shirts are very comfortable. The ""tagless"" t-shirt was a great design feature and it amazes me that it took so long. These shirts fit very well if you are a bigger guy, a taller guy. In fact, I found these t-shirts to be a bit too long. Well, I'd rather have my shirts too long than too short. There's no chance that this shirt will come untucked.

  Its been a while since I was able to find ""Big Men's"" size Fruit of the Loom brief's and so glad I finally did.  I spent over $110 last year on Jockey brand that seem to fit good but for some reason they put so much material in the crotch area that they are so uncomfortable in the warm weather.<br/>The Fruit of the Loom seem to be more ""airy"" and keep me comfortable and dry (sounds bad but true).  The waist band on the Fruit of the Loom don't cut into me like the Jockey do.<br/>The only negative thing I can say about the Fruit of the Loom is the leg opening is still a bit off but still beat the Jockey hands down.<br/>If your a big guy give these old stand by's a try again, still as good as they where 40 years ago!

  V-neck is low enough that you don't have to button your top button on a polo, but will show if you're a ""two-buttons-down"" guy.

Cotton is decent, no worse nor better than the $50 for 3 no-name brand I got at a big and tall shop.  Quality control is very consistent, no loose threads, no twisting.<br/><br/>Not as ""clingy / fuzzy"" feeling as Hanes, nor as soft / silky as Calvin Klein, though.  Don't go for Calvin's unless you are relatively slender.

  I wish I would have found these earlier in life. I'm not that tall but I couldn't tuck in typical undershirts after about 5 times through the wash. These are not any wider, so they fit me just as well, but I can actually tuck them in with my dress shirt!

Somewhat translucent next to the skin and transparent if it gets wet. 100% cotton and after first wash and wear it is not as soft as I'd like, but it should soften with a few more washes. Perfectly adequate for under a dress shirt. For the price, I can't complain.

I found a shirt that at least waits until lunch!  Higher initial quality than Costco's Kirkland Signature brand 6 pack.  Two-times the payment the second time is worth three-times the luxury every time.  Something Kirkland Signature seemed to forget in men's undershirts.  Lets see how long they last before looking like bleached bacon.  Good Job FOTL!.  Buying another 3 pack now.

  These were somewhat smaller than jockey shirts I have purchased.  However, these are roughly 3 bucks a piece vs 10 bucks a shirt from jockey.  I might go a size bigger when I order more... or, simply lose some weight.<br/><br/>Definitely love the length of the sleeve (not too long that it protrudes beyond the polos I wear) and extra length so that it remains tucked in.  Will definitely buy again due to value.  Only complaint is it is tighter on the body than other shirts.

  I bought a pack of these and the V-Neck to try out as an alternative to some overpriced ""Hdis&amp;ignerM"" long tees that fall apart after one wash. Couldn't be happier!!!<br/>I'm a 6ft 210lbs muscular build. Threw one on right away and loved the fit but the knit was a bit thin. Wore it for the day and then immediately threw it in the wash on HOT and then dried. Tried it on after and it shrunk to a perfect fit. The knitt tightened up as well so the shirt wasn't so thin looking anymore!!! Wash with some Oxi-Clean (not bleach) and it won't go dingy!

  These shirts are a good fit, even for a former football player who still goes 6'2"", 275 lbs. The shoulders as wide enough to not pinch your arms when you're working out or just moving around in the office. They are extra long and have no problems staying tucked in for me.<br/>The shirt is 100% cotton, so after an initial wash and dry (low heat with a dryer sheet) they are soft as a baby's cheek. I really like them for my workouts because they are big enough to move around in without having to worry about them exposing my ""lineman's middle"" to everybody in the gym.<br/><br/>Three comfortable shirts that fit will for less than $10?

Too Long & Too Snug, Unless You're Tall and Lean
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  GOOD POINTS :  Fair price and well-made.  I purchased Size 2XB.<br/><br/>THE PROBLEM :  The undershirts should be called ""Tall &amp; Lean Man"", NOT ""Big Man"".<br/><br/>I'm 5 ft 10 in., and ""filled out"" like most men as they age (but not obese).  The shirts are so LONG that if I was a 5 ft 10 in. female, I could use it for a DRESS.  Immediately, I grabbed the scissors and cut off a Several Inch high strip across the bottom end.<br/><br/>Also, the ""Big Man"" name implied there was ample room across the stomach area.  Not True.  The shirt is snug around the girth.  You shouldn't be able to ""feel"" your undershirt when you are fully dressed.

  Awesome! Just pure awesomeness. They fit wonderfully. A little too big but that’s because I’m accustomed to buying Xxxl’s. If I had listened to the reviews and gone a size down they’d be a perfect fit. However I am sure they will shrink so a little bit more room is always welcomed.

  Description of the kind of shirts my husband prefers:<br/>My husband where's a white T regularly as his go to everyday attire. He loved and preferred the finishline/champs/footlocker tall t's BUT they all no longer sell them. So we have been on a mission to find affordable tall T's. Stafford shirts are pricey but those are his current favorite.<br/>Description of the item:<br/>My husband is 6'4"" these shirts are thin and shrink all around. Even though they shrink all around including the length he is still able to tuck them in(barely).<br/>I would recommend hang drying them to try and save the length. Also My husband has to where a white tank top under due to the material being thin.<br/>While he was disappointed that he can't really where these as a daily shirt he is happy he can where them under his nice button up's for church or formal events. The fact that they're thin comes in handy there.

  These are longer than the average undershirt, thankfully.  My only complaint is that they don't come in Medium Tall, which would fit my tall, lanky son better than the large.  So far, they are washing and wearing well.  I would order more if he needs them, but really would prefer a medium.

  These are the first ""Tall"" undershirts we've found that live up to the name. My husband is 6'6"", with a long torso and....not the most fit middle. We've tried Calvin Klein tall (ok at first but shrank pretty quickly, even when hung to dry), Jockey (same as the CK) and Hanes (never long enough even at the start). These came mid-thigh to my husband straight out of the package. After washing and drying, they are about 1.5"" shorter than out of the package. (I'm in the habit of hanging his undershirts anyway, so I'll continue that, but I don't think shrinkage would be a problem either way.) They are decently thick and smooth, but still the nice lighter weight you want in an undershirt. The seams are straight and smooth, and I think these shirts will last a long time! We immediately bought three more packages and donated all his old shirts.

  I was looking for 2xlt v-neck tees and this looked like the best deal.  I have a general complain perhaps forgivable in an undershirt that tee shirt fabric seems to be getting thinner and thinner.  Price, service and delivery were all fine with this product.  If I knew of a better deal than this I would have chosen it.  As it is, I may end up purchasing more.

  Somewhere and Amazon's dialogue there was a claim that Fruit-of-the-Loom undershirts were made in the USA. The actual shirt label received indicated that they were made in El Salvador; otherwise all OK.

When these arrived I was so excited, I excite easy it is one of my many flaws, because it was long enough to tuck in and it STAYED. I wash most cloths in cold water and hang so I cannot really honestly talk to shrinkage. The shirts feel GREAT after several washes and I could not be happier.<br/>I paid the full Amazon price for these and  did this unbiased and honest evaluation.

  I'm 6'4"" and I've been buying Hanes brand tall undershirts for the past few years. I was looking for a cheaper alternative and decided to give these a try. The fabric is very nice, the fit is very good(after washing) for use as an undershirt(i.e more fitted than loose), they are the longest undershirts I've ever found almost verging on too long, but I rather have that than too short. Overall I think they're fantastic and I plan to buy more.

  I wanted to find some undershirts that had the length to go with the roominess of a bigger-sized shirt. I found it. These shirts have the extra length as well as extra fabric around the belly. They're absolutely comfortable and even hold up extremely well after washing.<br/><br/>One thing to note is that I'm regularly a 2X guy, so after going with the 2XB I found that maybe the 1XB would have done better in regards to being more form-fitting. Hence why I selected ""Somewhat Large"" in the box above. Of course, this is all dependent on the dimensions of the wearer and preference in fit. Nonetheless, I loved them and I will be ordering more in the near future!

  Never was a fan of Fruit of the Loom, but these tee shirts changed my opinion. I am 6’6” and have a very hard time finding shirts long enough. I was always a Jockey fan, but price and poor reviews lead me to check other brands. The amazon reviews for Fruit of the Loom were really good so I ordered a 3 pack of 3x long, a size larger than usual. Should have stuck with the 2x long, but very happy with my purchase. Extremely high quality, very long, and a terrific price, (around $4.00 per shirt).. order some, you won’t regret it.

  I'm 6'3"" 215 lbs with about a 37"" waist. The XL have been fine.  I really like longer shirts that stay tucked in at work instead of bunching up under my dress shirt.  I've ordered Jockey shirts that were way more expensive but were obviously better quality material when comparing side by side.  But since it's just an under shirt, these are perfect.  They do shrink up A LOT.  I ordered a second pack and compared one to a shirt I had been washing/wearing and there was a difference of several inches in length, at least an inch in sleeve, and probably a couple inches in chest.  So when you open the pack, keep that in mind.  They start out huge but shrink down when washed.

  These shirts are nice and long, fit well and a great price. A few weeks ago i purchased another brands (starts with H) A-shirts which were 3 for $20. Those were ""tall"" shirts and are pretty decent, but pretty pricey. I found these shirts at 3 for $10 and I am quite pleased to report that they are just as long as the other brand and fit just as well. The only reason I docked one star is because of the unfinished bottom of the shirt, which is negligible because these shirts typically get tucked in, but it might be a problem for the longevity of the shirt. Only time will tell if that becomes a problem, but for this price and the fact that these are really long (I'm 6'8"" tall) I am very satisfied!

  Bought 2 packs of the 3XB last year and loved them! I am over 6'1"", 310lbs, and lift weights. These t-shirts fit very well around the neck, chest, and armpit areas, and was a bit extra long to boot. At only $15 a pack, it was an excellent and satisfying purchase. They've held up great, but used them for so many occasions that I made them a bit dingy - not a product fault at all. I decided to repeat the order to get some refreshed shirts, but the price per pack is now almost $40 EACH! What a total scam that kills the sale for me, because I refuse to pay over double the past price for the same product.  It's a shame because FOTL has a great t-shirt here.

  Bought these 2XBig Fruit of the Loom t-shirts for my husband via Subscribe and Save here. He's about 6' tall, 240 lb and I like the extra width, nice comfortable look and he likes he fit. Very thin t-shirts, definitely undershirts, decent value.<br/><br/>My main dislike is that the collars are so wide. They look stretched out from the start, making for a very sloppy look if exposed under a sweater or something.<br/><br/>We've since switched to the Gildan ones available here, 100% cotton, and a bit thicker. Those aren't as widely cut and need to be washed cold to resist losing length. They're so cheap though, we'll likely replace them more often, although they're a nicer quality t-shirt overall. These are okay, recommended if you want the extra sizing. Hope this helps! Smile.

  So let me first state that these briefs are some of the most comfortable ones I’ve got from Fruit of the Loom.  I’ve originally bought 4 packs and 2-3 weeks later got an additional 4 packs. I’ve been buying Fruit of the Looms for many of years (I’m 48).  The fit great, don’t shift around and stay put throughout the day.  However the quality of these briefs is terrible.  Within 2-3 washes the in seams are ripping apart.  I already had to through away 6 pairs (that’s a total of 2 of the packages).  I have serious doubts the remaining briefs are going to last the next 3 months.  I believe these may be my last Fruit of the Loom products if that’s how the quality is going to be going forward.  Not worth the price I’ve paid for them.

<span>
  You know Big &amp; Tall stores? Well I’m both of those and finding tanks that don’t expose my bum crack is a chore.<br/>I bought these based on the (antiquated) notion the FoTL was good stuff. Not sure that is accurate anymore.<br/>Amusingly the packaging had a spot that said “feel the softness” but the packaging wasn’t cut out, so all you would feel was plastic. That should have been a clue. Well they weren’t soft when I opened them (mistake one).<br/>I tried it on and it was a little snug, but the length was good. After wondering how bad it could be and opening both packages I bought (mistake two), I washed them (mistake three). They shrank a bit and now they are even more rough feeling somehow. It’s like a tank top of white overly tight burlap that hugs you in all the wrong places. I half expect rug-burn-type rashes where these shirts hug and grind.<br/>And since I washed them, I can’t return them. Steer clear, oh reader, find something different!

  I purchased fruit of the loom shirts instead of Hanes based on several reviews here. I like lightweight men's v-necks for sleeping and around the house.  But I'm 5'7"" and even the XL's shrink to be too short in the length. So I ordered these FOTL tall XL's for the extra length. As expected, they shrunk overall down to a ""Large"" size after 1 wash &amp; dry. But they maintained enough length that they're good for a nightshirt. Exactly what I was looking for. They're a little heavier than Haynes but still very comfortable.

  Totally great white tshirt for a bigger guy. I am 6'1"" tall, weigh about 315lbs, and lift weights. This shirt fits perfectly around my neck and underarms, fine around the waist, and has the needed extra length to stay tucked in by itself or under an over shirt. After washing several times in hot water, they do the normal ""minor tightness"" when fresh out of the dryer, but then easily stretch back out with a gentle tug after putting back on. Each time, the neck stitching has maintained a nice collar around my neck, and is comfortable to wear in the house as a relaxed shirt, stay cool while outside grilling, and wear underneath other tshirts while exercising or household chores and sweating. Very good tshirt at a great price (under $20 for a pack of three).

  These are the absolute WORST undershirts that I have ever owned. Unfortunately, I was unaware of the wretched quality of the product until they were washed on several occasions.<br/><br/>I never use bleach on my shirts as it weakens the integrity of the fabric. Before I purchased these, the last brand of undershirt that I had war was made by Gildan. Before I purchased Gildan I purchased Fruit of the Loom because that's what I had before. I can honestly say that this was a regrettable purchase because Gildan produces a better product at a lower price.<br/><br/>I cannot return these undershirts and I have to continue to find holes in them as I continue to use them. This is the absolute last time that I will ever purchase undershirts made by Fruit of the Loom.

  This is my second time purchasing these t-shirts.. oh no they're not for my boyfriend or husband there for me! I love to wear t-shirts around the house that are big and baggy. These do not disappoint ! The material is very soft and they wash up beautifully. The only one thing I wish that Amazon would stop putting my packages in places to which I did not request. Like leaving my package by the mailbox when you're supposed to put the package at the customer door.. I live in a gated community but however that's not what I pay for in my prime membership.!! Oh yeah they've also thrown packages over the fence left them at the front gate on the bench we're in anybody could take things and people have.. but I digressed.. fruit of the loom has been around for a long time and they still crank out quality clothing.

The hems are a little narrower than my other FTL shirts and they didn't wash it as softly as I would like.  Maybe a few more washings will help.  That being said, the quality is not bad.  There are no flaws in the construction, loose strings or anything.  They did shrink about  half a size so order up for the best fit.  (I washed in cold water and dried on med.)

<span>
  Being 6'2"" and 210 lbs with a 35"" waist, I have an athletic/rugby build and do a lot of weight training.  Before purchasing this 4XL Big Man fit size, I actually wore the 3XL A-shirt undershirt by Fruit of the Loom and as I was gaining muscle mass, arm holes were chaffing underneath my armpits.  I liked the design of the 3XL having thin straps and the larger arm holes that gave a greater range of motion.  The 3XL was excessively long in height, but I knew it's what came with such a big size.<br/><br/>When I purchased the 4XL Big Man fit size, I though it would resolve the arm hole problem, but it didn't at all!  The arm holes for this 4XL Big Man fit size was actually smaller than the 3XL!  The seller's picture is very misleading in displaying this.<br/><br/>Although these Big Man shirts give more width for the chest and rib cage, the smaller arm holes make these A-shirts more uncomfortable, and this very noticeable whenever I lie down or turn to the side while in bed.  I had to resort to cutting the side seam 5-6"" down from the arm holes to stop the chaffing to make these garments useful and comfortable to wear.  If anybody is having underarm chaffing with their undershirts with any smaller sizes, avoiding buying this Big Man design, because the underarm chaffing will not improve with these A-shirts (aka tank top undershirts).<br/><br/>Maybe the ""Tall Man"" selection would have resolved my problem, but after monitoring the availability for 1-2 months before purchasing, a ""4XL Big Tall "" size never appeared.

I always struggle to find some that will fit not just in the waist but in the height as I want him to feel comfortable wearing something that covers everything. This ones work perfect would be buying more for him. So make sure you order a size bigger as this material shrinks over a wash but would definitely recommend them.

  These fit great, but know they will shrink.. I buy the tall size because the fruit of the loom undershirts always seem to shrink on me big time and I can no longer tuck them in. With the tall version, that is no longer an issue. They area really long at first, than after washing they are normal length. Way better than buying the normal ones than being too short for myself. I do on ocassion have issues hiding the v-neck collar under my shirt after its been work a bit.

  A man becomes accustomed to a certain style and fit when it comes to underwear. Previous purchases have been wearing out (as expected; men are rough on undergarments, so no complaint to be had there).

  These were awesome! Took a bit to convince my honey that he needed to switch to a big and tall style (he is 6'3""). Tried explaining that the reason all his t-shirts would rip under the arm is because they were too short and he was tugging so hard on them to be able to tuck them in to his pants. I bought these and convinced him to try them. He is ecstatic! The underarms aren't ripping, they are extremely comfortable and he can not only tuck them in with ease...they stay tucked in.

  These aren't perfect, but darn good enough.  Especially when you factor in the price.  It's tough to find a true big and tall undershirt - many brand I've tried are way to short, or the sleeves are too long, or the neck holes stretches way too much, etc.  But these are just a good, basic undershirt with no major problems in my opinion.  This is the second time I purchased these and the only issue I've noticed is that one shirt in the first package seemed to be slightly smaller than the others.

I had six and I just received six more in case I’m late getting the washing done. I want to wear only them! I’m giving all my others of non-FOTL brands to hubby. He’s not as fussy as I am!

  This is an update to my earlier review.  I forgot to include the size undershirt that I bought.<br/>It's listed as, LT 42-44 inches.<br/><br/>I'm a male, 5' 11"" tall.  Over the years I've had a difficult time finding white ""T"" shirts/undershirts that are long enough to stay tucked in.  I bought some of these undershirts and I'm VERY happy with them.  They are longer than most undershirts, and best of all, they stay tucked in.<br/>From the bottom of the crew neck edge to the bottom of the shirt is 27"".<br/>Even after a couple of washings, they still fit great.<br/>You won't be disappointed.

  I read a lot of reviews saying it was too snug. For all the bigger/taller guys out there that buy these ribbed shirts from Wal Mart like I do, I bought the size as I do there (2X) and it was the exact same size minus being about 3-6 inches longer. It definitely solved my issue of the under shirt not staying tucked in all day. It now takes an act of congress to become un-tucked for me.

  I'm 6'3"" with a long torso and was always complaining to my wife about how my undershirts would come untucked. It took me until I was 31 years old to realize that I needed the tall version of an undershirt. I'm an idiot for not realizing this was a thing for so long. Since my first purchase several weeks ago, I've ordered the pack of three twice more and am slowly replacing all of my old shirts. Its amazing how much more comfortable these things are when compared to having a shirt that is untucked. Do yourself a favor and try it out. At a minimum, you will get three new shirts that aren't grayed/yellowed and you should probably throw a few of the old ones out anyways.

","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Really disappointed in Fruit of the Loom on these. I initially purchased two packs, and shortly after went back for a third. The packaging comes with black and grey colored briefs. All of the grey colored ones, within two wearings and washings, started coming apart on several seams. And different seams on each one. I've had to toss the grey ones, but I've had zero issues with the black ones. And they are very comfortable. I'm no expert in any way with regards to stitching or sewing, but it appeared there just wasn't enough overlap in the seam area for the stitches to hold. Again, I expected better from FotL. If all had performed the way the black ones did, this would be five stars.

  These T-shirts are great. First time I've bought clothing through Amazon and I am so pleased. Until now I have bought T-shirts through local department stores, same Fruit of the Loom brand, same size, but these are so much better quality, less expensive, and I didn't need to drive to the store or jostle with crowds in the aisles or at the checkout stand. The material is heavier and the length is just perfect. They did not shrink when I washed them. Before now, the length of T-shirts was inconsistent and often several T-shirts in a package were too short. And those from stores would shrink after I washed them. I could not be more pleased. I will definitely be buying my T-shirts through Amazon from now on.

For three of those you're paying like $40. So I recently found these and I got three of them for $10 my husband is 6'5 so he can't buy any from like Walmart because they don't stay tucked in. But these are great and the price really helps!!!!

  I'm tall but not particularly wide, and have had a lot of trouble finding undershirts that fit. I need long-body shirts, but I also want a deeper V-neck than many sold today and also want sleeves that don't peek out from under short-sleeved shirts. These undershirts aren't made of the most luxurious material, but they're quite acceptable and have a moderately deep V-neck, short enough sleeves and a long-enough body. They did shrink an inch or so after washing, which was ok, as the initial length was more than adequate.

(His exact words are, ""These are awesome - totally awesome!)<br/><br/>I washed them first, so apparently they didn't shrink (and if they did, he loves the after-washed length, so it's all good).<br/><br/>I gave them a 4 because like other reviewers say, they could be softer. However, I asked my husband if he cared (or noticed) and he said no. After an evening of wearing one under a dress shirt, he still thinks they are awesome.<br/><br/>You can't beat them for the price.

Great shirt before washing! Shrunk in cold water...
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  First let me start out by saying these shirts WERE great straight out of the package. I am 5’9” and like my shirts loose and long. Size wise I wear a 4x snugly, 5x loose, and 6x baggy. They fit big and were quite long before washing. After a single wash in cold water, and a tumble dry on low, they shrunk considerably in height and width. What was once a baggy shirt that went more than 2 inches below my waist is now a snug shirt that is ¼ an inch above my waist. The shirts now fit similar to a 4x in width, however lost about 4 inches in length. Due to the shrinkage I have taken off 2 stars for my review.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>* Price, purchased at $10 for a 3 pack.<br/>* Nice bright white color.<br/>* Color didn’t fade after 3 washes.<br/>* Thin material, not too thick. Great for an undershirt and to wear in the summer.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>* Shrunk considerably after a single wash in cold water with a tumble dry on low.<br/>* Material is a bit stiff and scratchy.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>I might purchase these again, if the price is the same, to use as backup undershirts. If you’re under 5’9” and a 4x shirt is baggy on you then get the 6x size and they’ll shrink to fit. If you wear a 5x or 6x normally then I’d suggest you stay away and put your money towards a shirt that doesn’t shrink and fits truer to size after washing.

  At first when I put it on they were WAY long!  I thought this would be an issue... but I washed them in hot water with some towels and they are perfect.  They are true TALL fit.  I have gotten other brands that did not meet my expectations... but these are TOP notch.  I went ahead and ordered another set.  THANK YOU!<br/><br/>The FIT: Normally I order Large Tall because I like my undershirts tight under my dress shirts.  but the XL Tall after a HOT washing are just perfect!

  I will start off by saying that I am 6'4"". Since I was 16 or so I have had issues with keeping shirts tucked in and especially undershirts. These shirts are a life saver for me. The two pros for these shirts are that they do no shrink up on me and that they do not cost me an arm and a leg. I will disclaim though that when I wash and dry, I do not dry the shirts on a high heat, but a I utilize a low heat or air dry. It takes a bit longer, but it is worth it to reduce the risk of shrinkage. I am now looking at purchasing another package of these and looking for v-necks in the next 20 minutes.

  I originally ordered X-Large and had to return them and get XX-Large.  If you are like me and on the border of 2 sizes, go up to the larger size on these shirts.  The return and exchange was very easy with Amazon!  The shirts are about the right weight for me....not too heavy, but not real thin either.  Just a decent quality weight that is comfortable.  The shirts are quite long, which is exactly what I wanted.  No one should have any problem with these coming untucked.  Overall, I am very happy with the purchase, especially since I purchased them for an extremely low price from Amazon.

  These are really tall and I like em.  I am 6'5"" and they probably come down 8 inches below my waist.  But from experience, stuff shrinks for a full year, so these are really solid for a tall guy and will be even better once they shrink-in a bit.  Vs. the equivalent Hanes brand, similar quality of cotton it seems.  I prefer the neckline on the Hanes more.  It seems more natural.  The pro on these is they are longer.  I am 44 on shoulders and went a size up to the XLT.  I recommend that because they will shrink some over time I am sure.

  I had to go through quite a few shirts before I found these. The length of undershirts is critical to comfort. Other shirts are too short and will shrink to an even shorter length. I hate the feeling of an undershirt getting un tucked. Other shirts feel like your pants are full of shirt.  A good undershirt should be about the same length as the shirt being tucked in. These shirts are that length and don't shrink. The v neck is also great. For those unaware, the current business casual dress is to wear a bottom up shirt with the top bottom open and a v neck. I don't want to see any of you gentlemen with a crew neck even if you have overgrown chest hair.

  If you are an XL and have ANY XXL shirts in your closet or have thought, ""My XL shirts are tighter than they used to be"", go for the XXL.  The shirt fits great before washing but after washing, it fits like a glove - tight.  If you like that feeling, go with XL.  If you like for your undershirts to have a little breathing room, go for the XXL.  Other than that, the Tall shirt is good and longer than standard shirts - but length also shrinks some after washing.

  Great product.  My husband loves colored V-necks tees for everyday wear.  It is impossible to find those that are affordable and don't shrink so much in length that they show his belly in size large.  These size LT were perfect.  We purchased them twice and dyed them with some Rit so he had his colored V-neck Tees for the whole summer.  He loves them!!!!  We only wish they had long sleeve V-neck tees that we could dye for fall and winter wear.

  As the description says, taller not bigger or wider. Somewhat though to my chagrin as the neck opening is quite small and tight. Also tight against my chest and abdomen. Yes I'm heavier, but not obese... I am 6'0"", have a 32"" inseam and weigh about 220 pounds. I found the length acceptable to my other tall size shirts. Best advice to other purchasers, if you are thin and wiry, you'll probably love these shirts. If you are heavier, order up one size larger. IMO, they'd be a perfect fit for me if I'd gotten on size up from what I normally wear.

  I bought these tees for my son who is 6'6"" and 170 pounds - so, very skinny.  After one wash, they were about as long as a standard (not tall size) dress shirt, and shrunk a little more in the second wash.  These tees are a good choice for someone who is very tall but not too beefy - and that's a hard bill to fill.

The length however is still good for wearing tucked in while a sweater remains untucked, or a long sleeve shirt worn the same way...so good purchase, but I will keep looking for the extra long ones I really wanted.

  Thank goodness more undershirts are being made in tall sizes. They don't come untucked and bunch up at your belt, and they do the job of being an undershirt. Be realistic with yourself: your white undershirts will turn gray or yellow over time. You can wash them in different ways to maybe get a little more time out of them, but if you wear them once a week, just plan on replacing them every once in a while. The old ones can be rags of various sorts, or whatever.

  I'm a fat guy, about 5'11 and 300 pounds. I hate white undershirts that come untucked all the time, and these shirts completely eliminate that issue. They are long on me, really long. The probably go down about mid-thigh. After washing and drying they shrink some, but that's fine, because they are so long that even with shrinkage they are plenty long to do the job. They are also a little on the thin side, so they are cooler and more comfortable to wear for a fat, sweaty guy like me!

  Lets face it. I'm a bit chubby. So I like long t-shirts that stay tucked in.  These have good length and even with a few launderings, they have not shrunk and still have a great length.  I ordered 2 more packs as soon as I got these out of the dryer and found them to no lose length as so many other shirts have that I have tried.  Like I said, I ordered 2 more packs and will be a re-peat buyer of these.  At $3.32 a piece, they are way less expensive than the department store brand I was paying $11.00 each for on sale.  This is a keeper.

  I purchased these for my long-torsoed husband who always has a problem with his undershirts being too short and coming untucked. If we buy a standard undershirt (not the “long”), we have to buy up a size or two and then the shirts are far too wide and bunch up under his dress shirts. These are longer than the Hanes long shirts, and stay softer longer.

  The t-shirt was a great fit, and very comfortable, and soft after washing.  I wear this type of t-shirt under a dress shirt.  I order a tall version so it will be extra long and will stay tucked in as I move about during the day.  This is especially helpful as I am a little over weight and have a spare tire which can cause a normal length tee to pull out, especially as they get older and tend to shrink up a little

  These provided the extra length unneeded without extra ""size."" Now my undershirts stay tucked in preventing a bunch-up above my waist. They can sometimes cause a little bunch up around the pocket area, but not a problem and better than the alternative. Decent quality, not the softest or heaviest undershirt but far from the worse. Neck works well and stays below neckline of most shirts.

  I probably should have purchased an XL because the 2XL is a little baggy, which I suspected might be the case.  My husband is 6'2"" and 210 lbs.  Still, he is delighted with replacements for the tattered shirts he was wearing (and so am I), because he thought it would be a big shopping exercise to find the tall versions.

  Center back of one of the 3 shirts in the package measured 32"" long before machine washing and drying. One shirt came out of the dryer at 28.5"", one at 29"" and one at 30"".  Fabric is thin which might be fine if you want a lightweight T shirt, hems are narrow. Just-okay quality, not a good choice if you need a long/tall shirt that stays tucked in.

I thought I would try Fruit of the Loom as an alternative.  I ended up ordering several three packs after I tried the first 3 pack.  They have been washed several times and hold their shape well.

Not exactly ""V"" enough for me
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  The ""V"" in the V-neck is just a notch, hardly a ""V.""  You know why I wear ""V"" neck T-shirts? Because ""V"" stands for Victory.  That's right, I'm not dressing to go to work to lose. Nope, I want to go to work and stomp the living daylights out of my adversaries. I want Victory. Victory with an upper case, shouting ""V"" to begin my victory lap. And I want my T-shirt to reflect that attitude.<br/><br/>These shirts, on the other hand, are all about a lower case Pyrrhic victory. You know the kind of ""victory"" I'm talking about - the kind where you have to slink home and hope the neighbors didn't see you. The kind of victory that leaves your adversaries crying with laughter and asking you to please stop. No, it's worse that that - this ""v"" neck t-shirt is the kind of shirt where your adversaries call you up to tell you where you've hosed up and try to help you improve your performance.<br/><br/>And, in keeping with the overall theme that the shirt is for luuuusers, the fabric feels like a high grit sandpaper. But it's not all bad. The overall construction of shirt is quite good.  The stitching is tight and there are no loose ends on the shirts I received. The fabric looks like it will stand up to many washings.

  Great value. I ordered a 3 pack to test it out before ordering a few more. size 2XLT worked for me ((6'1"", 250lb). Washed and dried on high to get any shrinkage done, and it fit good, was plenty long. As others noted, length is great for wearing under a dress shirt so it doesn't get un-tucked and bunched up.

cost less than Jockey and it's clear why when you compare them
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  I have always worn Jockey but they haven't seemed as nice to me as they used to be and these were on sale and I gave them a shot. I haven't had them long enough to know how they wear, but they are significantly thinner than Jockey t-shirts. That may or may not be a positive for you but they seem cheap to me. Perhaps I'm being unfair, as they are indeed less expensive.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've now had these a year and I've worn them enough (or a few of them) so that if repeated washing could soften them, it would have happened by now. As I wrote above, at about $3/each they are cheap, but they're no deal. First, you can find Jockey's on sale for $6/each, which while twice as much, isn't much in absolute terms. And what I didn't notice right away is that these are called ""tall"" but they're not nearly as long as the Jockey version is.<br/><br/>The only positive thing I can think to say is that it's hard to find a tall medium and these are closer to that than the Jockey LT is. But they shrink in a way that Jockey's don't and the material difference is night and day.

  These fit great, and so far they are holding up quite nicely. If I had to come up with one criticism, I think the sleeves are a little short. Depending on whether you are wearing these as an undershirt or a normal shirt, that could be considered a positive or a negative, but if you want something with a longer/looser sleeve, grab the hanes. Otherwise, I couldn't recommend these more highly.

  It was time to replace some 10 year old or so ""rags"" I was using that I guess you could still call undershirts if you squinted just right.  Yes I hate to shop for cloths and wear them till they fall apart, Ok my bad but it is what it is.  I took the plunge and purchased 1 three pack to see how they fit, WOW, very comfortable!  I ordered a larger size not knowing really what size I needed since the old undershirts I had where so stretched out of shape and found they are nice and roomy but a bit too roomy.<br/>I love that they are REALLY BIG MEN'S size, which are hard to find, but you might know that already.  The shirt hangs down to my thigh which means a lot of tucking but sure feel great to have something that isn't like wearing spandex lol.<br/>If your a big guy - grab some while you can.  Price is great compared to some online ""Big Men's"" sites that charge $15 or more just for 1 undershirt.<br/>Please keep these in stock!!

  It's so hard to find undershirts for my husband who is 6'3"".  The regular size shirts just seem to shrink up after a few washes and then never stay tucked in when he wears them.

they are a much better fit the current crop of ""regular length"" t-shirts

<span>
  It appears that, in order to save money, some brands have shortened the length of their T-Shirt.  Now, at 5'7"", I have to buy a tall.  If you have really old Fruit of the Loom (my older ones are 10+ years), these are just slightly longer.  However, they are a much better fit the current crop of ""regular length"" t-shirts.  The length is about perfect but they are not very soft (800 grit sandpaper comes to mind).  Also, I wish it was available in a medium, rather than starting at large.<br/><br/>Hanes makes a Tall that is soft AND also the right length BUT the V is not quite deep enough.  Thus, if you use it as and undershirt, the Hanes shirt usually shows.  I have also tried upsizing the regular shirts in various brands but always wind up with something more wide than long.<br/><br/>I guess I can live with the coarseness to get the right size.  I'm just wondering what tall people use now.

  I am 6'6""/198cm. I have a long torso. T-shirts are always riding up on me. I have tall undershirts but I wanted some more. These were a great price and the reviews warned me they wouldn't be as soft as I would hope. So for the quality of the shirt, four stars, because the price is right. Cheapest extra long undershirts I have ever seen.

  These t-shirts are very comfortable. The ""tagless"" t-shirt was a great design feature and it amazes me that it took so long. These shirts fit very well if you are a bigger guy, a taller guy. In fact, I found these t-shirts to be a bit too long. Well, I'd rather have my shirts too long than too short. There's no chance that this shirt will come untucked.

  Its been a while since I was able to find ""Big Men's"" size Fruit of the Loom brief's and so glad I finally did.  I spent over $110 last year on Jockey brand that seem to fit good but for some reason they put so much material in the crotch area that they are so uncomfortable in the warm weather.<br/>The Fruit of the Loom seem to be more ""airy"" and keep me comfortable and dry (sounds bad but true).  The waist band on the Fruit of the Loom don't cut into me like the Jockey do.<br/>The only negative thing I can say about the Fruit of the Loom is the leg opening is still a bit off but still beat the Jockey hands down.<br/>If your a big guy give these old stand by's a try again, still as good as they where 40 years ago!

  V-neck is low enough that you don't have to button your top button on a polo, but will show if you're a ""two-buttons-down"" guy.

Cotton is decent, no worse nor better than the $50 for 3 no-name brand I got at a big and tall shop.  Quality control is very consistent, no loose threads, no twisting.<br/><br/>Not as ""clingy / fuzzy"" feeling as Hanes, nor as soft / silky as Calvin Klein, though.  Don't go for Calvin's unless you are relatively slender.

  I wish I would have found these earlier in life. I'm not that tall but I couldn't tuck in typical undershirts after about 5 times through the wash. These are not any wider, so they fit me just as well, but I can actually tuck them in with my dress shirt! They are worth every penny if your undershirts can't be tucked in after they shrink in the wash.

  The shirts feel a little thin - like they may wear out sooner compared to white Harbor Bay tees from DXL.  They are also not as soft as those tees, however I am still very happy with them as the cost less than half as much.  They have washed well in cold, and surprisingly have not drawn up at all when being dried.

  You get what you pay for.  This is a thin T. Somewhat translucent next to the skin and transparent if it gets wet. 100% cotton and after first wash and wear it is not as soft as I'd like, but it should soften with a few more washes.

I found a shirt that at least waits until lunch!  Higher initial quality than Costco's Kirkland Signature brand 6 pack.  Two-times the payment the second time is worth three-times the luxury every time.  Something Kirkland Signature seemed to forget in men's undershirts.  Lets see how long they last before looking like bleached bacon.  Good Job FOTL!.  Buying another 3 pack now.

Somewhat small compared to my other undershirts, but an absolutely awesome value!

  These were somewhat smaller than jockey shirts I have purchased.  However, these are roughly 3 bucks a piece vs 10 bucks a shirt from jockey.  I might go a size bigger when I order more... or, simply lose some weight.<br/><br/>Definitely love the length of the sleeve (not too long that it protrudes beyond the polos I wear) and extra length so that it remains tucked in.  Will definitely buy again due to value.  Only complaint is it is tighter on the body than other shirts.

  I'm a tall dude, so I am always on the look out for ""TALL"" clothing with little success.  These, however, fit exactly how I want them to fit, even after washing on hot and drying them in dryer (normally I wash my shirts on cold and air dry them to help reduce shrinkage).  Excellent job.

  I bought a pack of these and the V-Neck to try out as an alternative to some overpriced ""Hdis&amp;ignerM"" long tees that fall apart after one wash. Couldn't be happier!!!<br/>I'm a 6ft 210lbs muscular build. Threw one on right away and loved the fit but the knit was a bit thin. Wore it for the day and then immediately threw it in the wash on HOT and then dried. Tried it on after and it shrunk to a perfect fit. The knitt tightened up as well so the shirt wasn't so thin looking anymore!!! Wash with some Oxi-Clean (not bleach) and it won't go dingy!

  These shirts are a good fit, even for a former football player who still goes 6'2"", 275 lbs. The shoulders as wide enough to not pinch your arms when you're working out or just moving around in the office. They are extra long and have no problems staying tucked in for me.<br/>The shirt is 100% cotton, so after an initial wash and dry (low heat with a dryer sheet) they are soft as a baby's cheek. I really like them for my workouts because they are big enough to move around in without having to worry about them exposing my ""lineman's middle"" to everybody in the gym.<br/><br/>Three comfortable shirts that fit will for less than $10?

Too Long & Too Snug, Unless You're Tall and Lean
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  GOOD POINTS :  Fair price and well-made.  I purchased Size 2XB.<br/><br/>THE PROBLEM :  The undershirts should be called ""Tall &amp; Lean Man"", NOT ""Big Man"".<br/><br/>I'm 5 ft 10 in., and ""filled out"" like most men as they age (but not obese).  The shirts are so LONG that if I was a 5 ft 10 in. female, I could use it for a DRESS.  Immediately, I grabbed the scissors and cut off a Several Inch high strip across the bottom end.<br/><br/>Also, the ""Big Man"" name implied there was ample room across the stomach area.  Not True.  The shirt is snug around the girth.  You shouldn't be able to ""feel"" your undershirt when you are fully dressed.

  I like these shirts as they are a bit thinner and lighter than many others I have found, and living in Texas in the summer it can get HOT! The length is nice as they don't come untucked under your shirt. Overall, I will keep buying these as long as they are available.

  Awesome! Just pure awesomeness. They fit wonderfully. A little too big but that’s because I’m accustomed to buying Xxxl’s. If I had listened to the reviews and gone a size down they’d be a perfect fit. However I am sure they will shrink so a little bit more room is always welcomed.

  Description of the kind of shirts my husband prefers:<br/>My husband where's a white T regularly as his go to everyday attire. He loved and preferred the finishline/champs/footlocker tall t's BUT they all no longer sell them. So we have been on a mission to find affordable tall T's. Stafford shirts are pricey but those are his current favorite.<br/>Description of the item:<br/>My husband is 6'4"" these shirts are thin and shrink all around. Even though they shrink all around including the length he is still able to tuck them in(barely).<br/>I would recommend hang drying them to try and save the length. Also My husband has to where a white tank top under due to the material being thin.<br/>While he was disappointed that he can't really where these as a daily shirt he is happy he can where them under his nice button up's for church or formal events. The fact that they're thin comes in handy there.

  These are GREAT T-shirts my husband wears then under his polo's at work or lounging around the house. He is a big man (285lbs) and I needed something TALL and these are IT. They are truly tall, and did not shrink much upon washing!

  These are longer than the average undershirt, thankfully.  My only complaint is that they don't come in Medium Tall, which would fit my tall, lanky son better than the large.  So far, they are washing and wearing well.  I would order more if he needs them, but really would prefer a medium.

  These are the first ""Tall"" undershirts we've found that live up to the name. My husband is 6'6"", with a long torso and....not the most fit middle. We've tried Calvin Klein tall (ok at first but shrank pretty quickly, even when hung to dry), Jockey (same as the CK) and Hanes (never long enough even at the start). These came mid-thigh to my husband straight out of the package. After washing and drying, they are about 1.5"" shorter than out of the package. (I'm in the habit of hanging his undershirts anyway, so I'll continue that, but I don't think shrinkage would be a problem either way.) They are decently thick and smooth, but still the nice lighter weight you want in an undershirt. The seams are straight and smooth, and I think these shirts will last a long time! We immediately bought three more packages and donated all his old shirts.

  I was looking for 2xlt v-neck tees and this looked like the best deal.  I have a general complain perhaps forgivable in an undershirt that tee shirt fabric seems to be getting thinner and thinner.  Price, service and delivery were all fine with this product.  If I knew of a better deal than this I would have chosen it.  As it is, I may end up purchasing more.

When these arrived I was so excited, I excite easy it is one of my many flaws, because it was long enough to tuck in and it STAYED. I wash most cloths in cold water and hang so I cannot really honestly talk to shrinkage. The shirts feel GREAT after several washes and I could not be happier.<br/>I paid the full Amazon price for these and  did this unbiased and honest evaluation.

  I'm 6'4"" and I've been buying Hanes brand tall undershirts for the past few years. I was looking for a cheaper alternative and decided to give these a try. The fabric is very nice, the fit is very good(after washing) for use as an undershirt(i.e more fitted than loose), they are the longest undershirts I've ever found almost verging on too long, but I rather have that than too short. Overall I think they're fantastic and I plan to buy more.

  I wanted to find some undershirts that had the length to go with the roominess of a bigger-sized shirt. I found it. These shirts have the extra length as well as extra fabric around the belly. They're absolutely comfortable and even hold up extremely well after washing.<br/><br/>One thing to note is that I'm regularly a 2X guy, so after going with the 2XB I found that maybe the 1XB would have done better in regards to being more form-fitting. Hence why I selected ""Somewhat Large"" in the box above. Of course, this is all dependent on the dimensions of the wearer and preference in fit. Nonetheless, I loved them and I will be ordering more in the near future!

  I bought some of these Amazon brand shirts (small) a bit back (2 years or more) and loved that they actually fit me (male, 5'6"", ~130lbs). But now it seems they are being made by another provider or Amazon has changed the sizing because the small is much longer than it used to be and it's also a bit more baggy even after washing/drying on high heat.<br/><br/>If you're a bit bigger than me, I'm sure the shirts will fit fine but if you're body type is anything like mine, (string bean) you might feel like you're swimming a bit and they won't match your other Amazon shirts.<br/><br/>Quality and material are the same as well as keeping it away from animals with claws (these types of shirts are absolutely destroyed by claws due to their sweat wicking fabric), just wish Amazon would have let customers know that they changed the design or provider.<br/><br/>I may be finding another brand of shirt to use for long distance biking.

  I bought these a year ago and loved them. They were a great deal for a performance t - soft, stretchy, and comfortable with great moisture wicking at a low price  So recently I bought 8 more for a trip.<br/><br/>The quality has taken a real nosedive. The shirts have a strong off gassing smell even after laundering, and the material is notably stiffer and itchier. Both versions are 100% woven polyester, but the new one *feels* like cheap polyester - sticks to my skin when I move and looks shiny. At least it's still somewhat breathable and the colors are nice, the only reason this didn't get a 1-star.<br/><br/>I checked the label and the old shirts were made in Mexico while the new ones are made in El Salvador. I'm guessing Amazon changed their supplier to someone cheaper and this is the low-quality result. I definitely won't buy these again.

  I have gotten Amazon Essentials clothes before but this time it was really very disappointing. I usually check the reviews and comments before purchasing anything whether it's online or at a store. This type of ""performance"" shirt can be found at other stores (like *otLess or *ack's here in NYC) a little cheaper and with a similar quality. Alas, I decided to give Amazon Essentials a try since I'd gotten other clothing items before which have been okay. Well, after I washed it the first time (following the instructions), you can see in the pictures how there's already some damage due to the poor quality. I would like to say, ""you get what you pay for"" here but, in this case, it is not like they were super cheap, unfortunately. I am hoping that the other shirt holds up better as I am not looking forward to writing, yet, another review.

  Pleasantly surprised at the quality of material, putting it on-par with higher-end offerings for workout shirts. But the sizing is, in a word, WEIRD. It’s oddly long and too big in spots while bizarrely well-fitting in others. And what really trips me up is that between the two shirts they fit differently. What forms are they using to create these? Or did I just get a one-off lemon? I’ll still use — if I have nothing else available at the time.

  Initial impressions were good. The material was sweat wicking and the price is right. After a few washes, the treads in a few places were already coming out. These may last a year or two depending on how often you workout and wash them. Ideally you wouldn't want to wear a sweaty shirt more than a couple of times.

  Somewhat baggy for a ""performance"" tee, but inexpensive. They're also a little longer than usual for ""L"" on my 5'11"" average-to-athletic frame.<br/><br/>These don't feel or fit like most technical tees do, and the material feels a little cheap. But they are a whole lot cheaper in price too. Depending on your build, they may be a better choice than brands like UA, especially if you need a little extra room, or if you're 6'1"" or taller

  I asked my husband to try out these Amazon Essentials Performance Pintec T-Shirts. Now he’s completely hooked on them. My husband owns a lot of t-shirts, but mostly tends to wear these to exercise and as underlayers. He likes the moisture-wicking fabric which keeps him cool and dry. The size large fits him as it should, and the athletic fit cut looks flattering. The shirts have a generous length which suits his physique. The shirts are also tagless so there’s no scrathiness behind the neck. This 2-pack set comes in black and dark grey, both of which make the shirts look sleek and modern. The shirts also have a subtle reflective logo at the back. My husband wants to replace all his t-shirts with these now because they are so useful to him, both as workout shirts and as cool, comfortable undershirts. I’m showing this pack in the size Medium, which I also ordered for my son.

Light Fabric - Great for Outdoors

  What I like best about these shirts is the lightness, breatheability, and softness of these shirts.<br/><br/>If you like to exercise, or work outside, these may keep you cooler.<br/><br/>The white seemed to be a little grayer through the chest area - like a distortion of the fabric, or someone stepped on it with a dirty shoe.<br/><br/>These shirts looked a tad bigger than a medium to me, but my nephew says the size is accurate as a medium. I got these for my nephew who works in landscaping outside.  He likes them.<br/><br/>If you sleep in a t-shirt, as my son does, you might like these especially.<br/><br/>There are no annoying collar tags to irritate your skin.<br/><br/>These are 100% polyester, and are washable.  Personally, I prefer a mix of cotton and polyester.  If you like 100% polyester, you may like these.

   These are classic enough to either wear to the gym/workouts or just for everyday use<br/>The material is 100 % polyester<br/>Breathes well the moisture-wicking makes a big difference when it comes to feeling dry and comfortable.  Especially if you are a bit prone to sweating - let's be honest no one likes embarrassing wet spots<br/>The shirts have a small double stitched hem and collar that in my opinion give them a bit of versatility.  Stylish enough for everyday wear yet still functional for the gym or outdoor activity.<br/>After a  couple of washings, the stitching and material showed no signs of breaking down<br/>The material is lightweight and being polyester there is a bit of give to the fabric allowing for ease of movement whether it be working out or just everyday wear.

Great value for solid basics

<span>
  Great value for solid basics<br/><br/>At current pricing of nine bucks a shirt, these simple dri-fit style tees are versatile and feather light. I have tried several brands over the years and have learned that Nike quality can be all over the map depending partially on price point, but also on which particular factory across the bond did the manufacturing. This practical set from AE is on par with brands such as Champion you will find at sporting goods and better quality discount stores like the one with the big red circle.  Highly recommended, especially at this price, and also  great for layering.

  Amazon Basics tend to be very reliable. Their clothes and other products come in simple packaging and are made of quality materials. This is no exception. One aspect I like about these shirts is that they are different colors, so it doesn't feel weird to wear one one day and another the next. They fit well, just slightly on the larger side, but I'd describe them more as relaxed fit than being too big. They wash well and have held up through repeated use.

  These shirts came out of the bag reeking of something between body odor and burnt plastic. At first I thought the were used and returned, but I think it’s a byproduct of the manufacturing process. They absolutely stink terribly and highly recommend washing the hem immediately after delivery. They are also very thin and cheap feeling compared to other brands.

  These are great shirts for the cost! The colors are nice and they fit perfectly. True to size. Typically order a large and that's what I got in these. 6'2'' and 180 pounds. The price is right too. I've worn and washed them multiple times- still look good and the color hasn't faded at all. I don't do anything special, just throw them in with everything else. If you're looking for a cheap shirt that's a nice quality with performance material, give these a try!

  Amazon products have consistently exceeded my expectations, this shirt 2 pack is no exception. Breathable, moisture wicking fabric, sports tees, on black and one great. They run a little large, so if you order medium to large and expect a wash &amp; dry to take the size do wn for you, this won’t happen with this space-age fabric. Sturdy, quality made, I highly recommend this for your next workout gear choice.

  These are nice basic shirts. Got the 2 pack with one white and one black shirt. Both run a little bigger than expected but still fits alright.<br/><br/>These shirts are made of a soft fabric that may be an issue for someone who's conscious of their nipples standing out. This is my biggest issue with these shirts. But I can still wear them under an open shirt or as undershirts.

  I bought the two pack of black shirts in XXL.  They fit pretty well and initially though they were just might be a little big until I washed them.<br/><br/>I then bought the B&amp;W two pack in XL.  These were a bit too small and I now realize the XXL are much better fitting for me.  I would however like to see the white shirts offered in a two pack or see these shirts sold individually.  Overall great shirt!  I primarily wear them as under shirts under a polo.

  I got these two shirts as I have been going to the gym to workout. It is very good quality shirt that fits true to it's sizing. The material is really nice and helps keep me cool as my body temperature and heart beat rises. I've been using this shirt when doing weight lifting, to cardio, and even indoor rock climbing. I wash it with similar colored clothing on a regular wash cycle and regular drying cycle. There's no lingering smell or sweat discoloration.

  Nice shirts.  Fits pretty much as expected on me at ~73.5"", 185lbs.  Shirts are the smooth fabric that looks wet when sweating, but dries very quickly.  They are comfortable, but also look good.  The colors are the basic type that I like anyway, so this is a great 2-pack.

  These are decent quality workout tees at a very reasonable price. At the time of this review the retail price was $18 for a pair of tees. They wick moisture nicely and machine wash and tumble dry and come out looking great. They are 100% polyester but they don't stick to things or hold static like some polyester clothing. The quality feels very nice.<br/><br/>My husband normally wears a medium and this medium fit him perfectly.

material is a bit rough

<span>
  As sports shirts, these generally live up to expectations. They dry quickly and are thin, but not translucent. They are lightweight and fit as expected. They look trim and are well-made with no flaws. The main point that I didn't care for was the feel of the material. I have similar shirts which a much silkier feel and a finer weave that perform similarly when exercising. These just feel coarser and rougher and aren't as good feeling on the skin as I would like.

  These Amazon Essential Men's 2-pack performance T-Shirts are true to size, well-made with a good quality fabric, comfortable and flexible. The only thing I don't like much is that the fabric is so thin that details of one's body can be seen. But for working out that's not a big issue, and I like to wear these T-shirt at home too. They are very easy to wash and dry, and overall, a good choice.

  This shirt is great, comfortable and has been lovely in the florida summers. The only issue I've had is that it snags on everything and you get little tears or pulls on it. I've bought 4 of them, but won't buy any more because of that unfortunately.
