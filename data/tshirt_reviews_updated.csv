  I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8"" and 140"", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked.<br/><br/>I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.<br/><br/>Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.<br/><br/>Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.<br/><br/>Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.<br/><br/>I hope that this review is helpful to you.<br/><br/>Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer.  Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.<br/><br/>I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out.  I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however,  I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.<br/><br/>I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.<br/><br/>Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.<br/><br/>June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.<br/><br/>September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.<br/><br/>November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them.  They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.<br/><br/>November 28, 2020 -  I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.<br/><br/>March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.<br/><br/>September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.

  My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.

  I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.<br/><br/>I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.<br/><br/>I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.<br/><br/>FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.<br/><br/>GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.<br/><br/>VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.<br/><br/>UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.<br/><br/>SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.

  I’m a big girl. 5’3” and 250 lbs. I usually wear XL or XXL because sizes are so inconsistent. These shirts are a true XL! They fit my chest without pulling up too much in the front. They aren’t too snug but don’t look loose and frumpy either. The material is thick and even though they might shrink a bit in the wash, there’s enough room that they still won’t be too small. I’ll definitely be buying these again.

  Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.<br/><br/>So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.<br/><br/>Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.<br/><br/>A great find!

100% Cotton so Buy Next Size Up

  These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.

  Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like. I am a throw it in the laundry and go type so I needed bigger so I could shrink it. I am 250 lbs and 5'11 with a beer gut. I got the 2x and it fit just a touch too big and after 1 wash it is perfect. After a few more washes I might have wished on a 3x but not sure yet. As of now they are perfect and am happy. Only thing that will change when I order more is color and  possible size upgrade if it continues to shrink.

  The fabric on this shirt is very stiff, even after washing. I bought these for undershirts and they're way too thick and stiff to be worn under another shirt. On top of it, the sleeves have huge wings that stick out and look terrible. This shirt definitely does not hug the arms. Unfortunately I've already washed them so I'm stuck with them and I will never wear them. Such a waste of money.

  They use the words ""Soft premium cotton"", but I don't think Gildan knows what soft is.  I've ordered many different brands of T-Shirts in my quest to find a favorite.  These are by far the roughest feeling yet(before and after wash/dry).  These will either end up being cut into rags or in the clothes donation bin.

  Do you enjoy heavy tshirts that are just a little too snug? Do you enjoy getting your nipples rubbed completely raw? Then, this shirt is for you, mate. Not only is the stitching shoddy, but the fabric, supposedly 100% cotton, feels like it was made from dry oak leaves. I've always loved Gildan shirts... until now. Something has gone completely wrong over at that factory.<br/><br/>Best stick with Fruit of the Loom or Hanes.

  While it isn't necessarily true that you get what you pay for, this is definitely one of those cases. This T-shirts are cheap, in more than one way. The fabric is 100% cotton, but a coarse, rough cotton, and the cut is slightly awkward. The fabric is not especially thin, probably a little thicker than most shirts I've worn, but the seams fold over themselves more than most shirts. Overall lower in quality than the bulk Gildan shirts I've worn.<br/><br/>However, it's not uncomfortable, and the sizing or the shape isn't abnormal enough that it looks weird on me. Despite its flaws, it should considered decent as a value T-shirt, and is certainly acceptable for many people; however, those looking for good quality should consider more expensive options.<br/><br/>(Size purchased: medium; on a male height 5'9, weight 160 lb, fit is as expected)

  These Gildan T-shirts are just the right fit for me. And, being a little on the ""hefty"" side, that's not an easy task.<br/><br/>I buy the 3X sizes and they're just right: not too tight, not too big. I would describe them as a little loose-fitting on me, but I prefer that. So, if you like a tight fit and you're in between sizes, you may want to opt for the smaller size. Otherwise, they fit just fine. During this pandemic, I've spent more time than I care to admit in ""PJs"" as I now work from home, and I like these shirts so much that I've repurchased them several times in different colors. I really like that you can get so many different color combinations.<br/><br/>As for strength of materials, of all these shirts I've purchased (probably over 20), I've never had a shirt rip or tear. I'd definitely recommend these T-shirts. They do the job and at a reasonable price.

  Very disappointed with these T's. After the first washing the bottom hems unraveled. Also the material is super scratchy. They are pretty much useless to wear un-tucked due to the unraveled hems.I have purchased much less costly white T-shirts from Gildan and was quite pleased with them.

  ***UPDATE 6/19/2019***<br/>I've only had the shirts for about 6 months and both have shrunk and faded significantly. The neck collars have rolled up. I bought these Gildan Dry-blend shirts and the fit is much better, perfect thickness on the shirt itself: (https://www.amazon.com/Gildan-DryBlend-Workwear-T-Shirts-XX-Large/dp/B07CX3XMFT/ref=pd_yo_rr_rp_2/141-5517899-8468140?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07CX3XMFT&amp;pd_rd_r=51dfdb89-fe12-47f6-bec1-66f0dbc9851e&amp;pd_rd_w=p22dQ&amp;pd_rd_wg=Jt0Xi&amp;pf_rd_p=5b2bffa6-877f-4dbd-a411-9578bf4fd009&amp;pf_rd_r=8EMXACPZBHN110PMNXFN&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=8EMXACPZBHN110PMNXFN). They also have a non-pocket version: (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07682FRBZ/?coliid=IAN1C6Q10TQF8&amp;colid=1ZFIFIDGDAF4T&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it). Even the Gildan shirts that I got in a multi pack lasted much longer. If you're a bigger man looking for long lasting undershirts, get the Dryblend shirts or 5 pack instead.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>If you ever used Stafford undershirts from JCPenney then you'll love these! I've searched everywhere for years for black midweight undershirts close to the ones JCPenney used to sell. And I am so glad I gave these from Gildan a shot! The fit is perfect and the shirts aren't see through. They do a good job of hiding your skin! I bought a multipack of undershirts from Gildan but these are definitely thicker! They also last quite a while! No issues with armpit seams tearing of hems rolling up. Great for self-conscious Big &amp; Tall men! I will definitely be ordering more!

  I bought these to wear under a shirt or sweater with the neck showing.<br/><br/>The Good: They are long enough which is a problem for some colored T-shirts.  The material is about average thickness.  I have some nicer T-Shirts that are a bit thicker, but I've seen thinner material T-shirts too.  The material is softness is about average.  For the price, they're decent thickness and soft enough.  You'd have to spend much more money to get better.<br/><br/>The Bad: These fit weird.  The sleeves flare out which I've never seen in a T-Shirt before.  Also, the shoulders are too wide; the shoulder line is past my shoulder.  I've never had this problem with any other T-Shirt ever.  The neck is a bit loose.  I was hoping from other reviews that the neck would lay flat.  Though I've seen looser, I can't say these lay flat.

Gildan White G2000 not made like the Gray G2000 'T' shirts.
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Since the Stay-At-Home deal some of us have gained a little weight, so, to keep up with my body type I purchased a bunch of  Gray G2000 'T' shirts. These gray shirts looked and fit great even after machine washing. I decided to buy a bunch of white G2000 'T' shirts to tie-dye. The Gildan White G2000 aren't made like the Gray G2000 'T' shirts.  The gray were a heavier grade cotton, with better stitching et cetera.  So, I thought that I'd get some of the same type in White.  I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the shirts that I received, not only were they of cheaper quality cotton, synthetic thread was used to stitch to shirt which shows up like a spot light (when tie-dyed)because (of course) synthetic thread will not take up Procion MX dye.  If the shirt description states 100% cotton the shirt should be 100% cotton, otherwise the description should state that the shirt stitching is synthetic and not 100% cotton. There should be no difference in quality of materials between the 2 colors of shirts but there was. The difference in a tie-dye between a quality white shirt and the Gilda G2000 is night and day. I feel 'sullied and unclean' for having used the White G2000 'T' shirts. One can be sure that I will no longer use the Gildan product even to clean the floor.<br/>So, no i'm not happy with this product at all. Each time I wear one of these shirts i'll be reminded of my disappointment when I see the sleeve, neck and tail stitching.

  Just got my first 2 pack, no holes or damage or major irregularities.  Washed them and dried them on high.  I'm 5'10"" and thin and bought medium and they fit *pretty much* as expected, after a little normal shrinkage which I also expected.  I've got a fairly normal torso length and the bottom sits roughly 4 inches below the top of my pants, which I wear a bit low on my waist.  Any longer and I'd say it was too long but I can just reach in my front and back pockets without the shirt really getting in the way which is nice and I don't look like I'm wearing some kind of ladies night shirt.  Thickness is what I'd consider decent mid-weight for a t-shirt.  Not remarkably thick or heavy but definitely not light or thin.  I'd expect them to last a good while of active service as long as the stitching stays good.  Sleeves are fairly standard if not on the short side but nothing to an unusual degree or worth complaining about.  Arm holes also pretty on point, not to big, not bunching in the arm pits.  The neck hole seems a touch on the small side, ok for me as I have a skinny neck, and again not extreme enough that it seems way off base or anything.  Only real complaint is it seems to have an odd cut that's kind of hard to describe like the front is bigger than the back.  Like if you stand up perfectly straight with your shoulders back and really puff out your chest and almost arch your back the front of the shirt hangs normal, but if you have a relaxed posture the neck kind of rides up the front of your neck a bit and there's unusual bagginess in the chest and belly.  And no my posture's not perfect and yes I am skinny, but 45 years of wearing t-shirts I can say this one hangs a bit weird.  Not even like it's designed for someone with perfect posture and an athletic build, more like it's designed for someone with a flat back and front side like a barrel.  And if you hold it up by the shoulder seams or hang it similarly on a hanger the front isn't longer than the back so it's like the front is somehow wider or rounder than the back.  And it does seem to be snug on the front of your neck while the back of the neck and loose and has an odd wrinkle whether you stand up like there's a rod in your spine or not.  One has the odd wrinkly bit in the back neck area when folded fresh out of the dryer and one folds flat and normal so perhaps not the strictest manufacturing tolerances.  It's not too extreme so hoping some wearing, maybe manually stretching it out somehow, and washing cycles will break it more normal.<br/>Fairly satisfied but not really over the moon.  If they weren't so cheap and everything else on the market wasn't such trash I'd likely be a lot less satisfied.  It's decent quality fabric, which you would think would be fairly standard, it used to be, but is worthy of remark now that cheap garbage has become the norm. And has a slightly odd cut, but not quite odd enough to make it intolerable.<br/><br/>Specifics in case the listing changes:<br/>Gildan Men's Ultra Cotton T-Shirt, Style G2000, 2-Pack, Charcoal, Medium<br/>Sold by: Amazon.com Services LLC

  The shirts were such a good price and had good reviews so I took a gamble on them. I ordered a two pack of the blue and a two pack of the green.<br/><br/>Ordered the 2XL and the shirts fit great when they arrived. I decided to go ahead and order two more in grey.<br/><br/>Turns out I should have waited to order the grey shirts till I washed the first ones a few times.<br/><br/>The Blue and Green shirts shrank about an inch to an inch and a half in the dryer. I only wear them around the house now. They are now too short, they fit as long as I don’t raise my arms at all.<br/><br/>The Grey shirts have held up better. When I wash them I hang them up to dry and so far they haven’t shrunk any. I have washed them a couple of times at this point.<br/><br/>My conclusion and experience so far is they are good cheap shirts that fit as long as you never put them in the dryer.

  Most of the pictures don't do this shirt justice. I unfortunately have gyno from puberty, most t shirts are paper thin and show everything off, these do not. With the black or navy blue gildan shirt no one can see anything. These are my favorite shirts, they are cheap, cotton, they hide everything, they are thick and wear nice.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that like all tshirts they are too short, and if not careful you will show your back when bending over.<br/><br/>Another thing that I REALLY love about these shirts is that the neck hole is tight and doesn't stretch out like a lot of thin tshirts. That's a huge pet peeve for me.<br/><br/>I have tried walmart shirts and they all suck IMO, this is the shirt I trust. I think if you take a chance on these shirts you will like them. That being said remember these shirts will shrink over time, that's just the nature of cotton, it's unavoidable, but IMO these shirts look and feel better with age.

These are an addition to the other Gildan shirts in his closet.++update++ washing and putting in the dryer resulted in shrinkage which is to be expected with 100% cotton, but going forward with these shirts and with the others that I'm waiting on, I will be hanging to dry. The softness seems to have disappeared as well. They were so soft until being washed. Now, it's just like any other random t shirt out there. A bit disappointed 😞

  I used to get St Johns Bay colored t shirts at Penneys which I wear as overshirts in the summer.  There are two things I consider musts:  No pocket (uncomfortable and useless) and 100% cotton.  But lately they seem to only have 60% cotton 40% synthetic.  It's easy to get 100% cotton white t shirts in the underwear department, why don't they use the same material for colored t shirts?  I have no idea.<br/><br/>I have quite a few of the ones from Penneys but not all the colors I would like.  So I got a couple of 2 packs of these to give them a try.  Note that if you want 100% cotton you have to be careful to choose the colors that are indicated as being 100% cotton and not synthetic blend.<br/><br/>They do have labels, but not too big a deal just cut them off as other people have suggested.  What concerned me more is that the cloth feels more coarse than that of the t shirts I am used to.  The whole reason I only get 100% cotton is that I am especially sensitive to discomfort in my clothing. (it's hell if I get a little fragment of a piece of popcorn under my t shirt)<br/><br/>But I was pleasantly surprised that these are virtually as comfortable as the all cotton T shirts I already have that use what I guess is a higher thread count material.  In addition, the neck fits perfectly.  The Penneys ones fit pretty well, but some didn't quite feel like a perfect fit.  Another point- they will probably get even a bit softer after they have been washed a few times.  But one washing (I always wash new clothes before wearing) is enough for these to be comfortable.<br/><br/>As to shrinkage that some customers mentioned.  I got medium just like the ones I got from Penneys.  They may be just a tad bit tighter coming out of the dryer.  However, pretty close to the same.  I don't find shirts comfortable if they are tight to my skin, so with T shirts, when I put one on, I always stretch it a bit with my hands so they don't hug my stomach or arms.  After doing this, the shirt fit just fine.  And they should be even better after I lose a few pounds which I have got to do.<br/><br/>The other good thing about these is that they are cheap.  They are fairly light weight but to me that's a plus since I get them to wear in the hot season of the year.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, for me these are keepers.  I will probably buy another 1 or 2 two-packs.<br/><br/>I was going to give these 4 stars but I am so picky and these meet so many of my finicky requirements that I figure they've earned 5 stars.

  These two shirts came as described. I did order one size higher than I normally would and I regret that as after washing these are still too large to wear out and about. I buy my shirts large and long for comfort reasons so usually a 2xl after washing is perfect comfort wise, so I bought 3xl this purchase based on all the reviews. I can use them for around the house but I won't be wearing them out anywhere. For the price though I'm not really that upset. I may even buy another set a size smaller and see. The pink is like an 80's neon pink btw. The thickness is right in the middle of light and thick. They are pretty soft after one wash considering the thickness but they aren't like 30 washes soft. Just not stiff thankfully. Also, these did not run at all when I washed them. I wouldn't recommend pushing your own luck like I did but just as an FYI I was shocked that none of my other clothes turned pink, even my white tank.<br/>So for just about $8 total with tax included this was still a deal for two tee's IMO.

  I bought these black shirts for my bf and had high expectations due to all the positive reviews.  However,  I was quickly disappointed because the shirt, fresh out the package, had white stuff on it. My bf is very detail oriented and brought it to me showing the white crap. What is it? And why it is on a brand new shirt out the plastic??<br/><br/>Also my bf is 6'2 and the shirt is too short as it hits above the belt. So anytime he reaches for something or just raises his arms up,  the shirt goes way up, exposing his stomach.<br/><br/>I think I'll stick with Kingstead shirts from now on. Even though they are more expensive, they have better quality, clean and ready to wear out the package and fits him perfectly where it falls below the belt.

  As my title suggests, Gildan product has changed.

Sometimes both.<br/>These specific shirts, lost their color at two washes.<br/>These are build more robustly than the G5000 I bought here on Amazon, and have retained 80% of their size. They did shrink a little bit after they’ve been washed and dried, I give em a stretch before putting them on. I use them for work so they don’t need to be perfect.<br/>So that all said, I do recommend them if it’s more important to keep its size over its color.<br/>You won’t get both.<br/>I’ve been looking and buying, trying to find ones that offer both. Gildan just doesn’t seem to be the one for that.<br/>I’ll add that years ago I bought some some Michael’s on a sale they had and they had both size retention and their color lasted months of washing and drying. I may try them again.<br/>There ya have it. Good luck!

Uncomfortable shirts. Feel like the sleeves are on backward
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Right off: If I had tried them on before laundering, I would have returned these shirts.<br/><br/>They are so uncomfortable. I got an XL because I don't like tight shirts. These have enough room in the body, but if your body doesn't completely fill out the shirt (which would make it fairly snug), it does not hang right, so it feels like the sleeves are on backward. Like this: If I have my arms straight down, it's fine; and if I move my arm backward, it's fine; but if I raise my arm forward, it immediately pulls taut on the sleeve because I don't have a huge chest pushing the front of the shirt way out.<br/><br/>I've been wearing XLs for a while and I've only experienced this kind of cut once, with a Hanes T-shirt. I guess if I was bigger it would make things line up properly, but then the shirt would also feel too small. I have other shirts from this brand but this cut is much different.<br/><br/>They run a little on the short side, which is another reason I went with XL.<br/><br/>That said: The material is really good - heavy and you can tell it will last. If you wear them more fitted, they'll probably be OK for you.

LACKING IN QUALITY AFTER SEVERAL WEARS
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  The quality is really lacking (I’ve noticed a decline in product quality over the years).  After sever uses this product starts to come apart at the seams, many loose hanging threads, over stretched neck line (collar).  Again like so many other brands, the tee shirt sleeve are not long enough, the overall tee shirt quickly loses its fresh, new appearance and becomes another old “around the house” work shirt.  I guess in today’s market there are very few true quality products available to the general consumer.  My suggestion is to compare prices and take a chance on the competitors product, it may surprise you in being better quality at a cheaper price.  Brand named definitely don’t mean better products these days, it means they can command top dollar for equal or less equal product quality.

Disappointed-Gildan no longer makes nice shirts. Bad fit, rough fabric, not worth cheap price
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  I do not understand all the high ratings for these shirts.  These fit oddly and poorly. The neck is loose, the shoulder seams are spaced way too far apart (as if made for the shoulders of someone 4 sizes larger than XL--and I do have broad shoulders), the armpits have too much fabric &amp; are baggy, the arm holes are too big, the part over the torso and waist is not generously cut.  The main part of this shirt (the part over your abdomen and waist) is seamless--no side seams. That might explain the odd cut.  I have many older Gildan t-shirts that fit more normally, and made of soft cotton. I previously tried the slightly lighter-weight current version, and it was incredibly thin, but also fit terribly. This model has heavier fabric, but the fit is unusable and the fabric is rough and not soft. I compared this t-shirt to six older t-shirts that I already own--all acquired from different places and made by various companies, including Gildan.  This one is far worse than my others, and the lousy fit is my biggest reason for sending them back.  At one time, I thought Gildan made great t-shirts, but after I tried several current models and colors and was disappointed, I am giving up on this company, and will try another brand.

  We love these shirts. I've purchased so many for my husband over the years. They're so comfortable and soft but still a nice thick cotton (my husband hates thin cotton shirts 😂). They wash nicely and don't shrink much if at all. They're great for using on Cricut projects (ironing on patches, vinyl etc). My husband buys a size large and he is 5'8-9 and weighs roughly 175 pounds and has a longer torso so he loves that this fully cover his mid section and doesn't ride up as much as normal shirts do. Very happy with these shirts!

  I've never had a problem with Gildan t-shirts as far as the brand before, no matter where I purchased them from - their quality has always been great and they last.  Wish I could say the same for the shirts I received in this order.  I haven't even had these shirts 4 months and each has only been worn 2-3 times and already they're so stretched out you'd think I'd had them for years and worn/washed them over a hundred times.  The bottoms of both t-shirts have stretched out and they resemble maternity shirts when worn now.  I have other Gildan brand t-shirts in the same color that I purchased elsewhere that are several years old that don't even look this bad.  I'm not sure if this was a bunk batch, if Gildan product has gone downhill, or if somehow these weren't true Gildan at all and maybe were some knock off brand.  Unfortunately, by the time I wore each of these a few times and noticed that they were already wearing out, the return window had passed.

  These seem like a good value for the money. There are better deals for sure on shirts like these, but none of the better deals have shirts for the larger man. They usually all stop at 2x, with a few offering 3 or 4x. It is hard to find good low priced shirts in larger sizes. It is hit and miss as to how well they run true to size. These were tighter by far than other brands of the same size. Forget the fact of how it was after the first wash...  I ended up retiring these to be used for automotive rags. I am in no way saying these are not good shirts, on the contrary, they were very well constructed and super comfortable. They were just smaller than expected. If you find a size that works for you, don't hesitate, as these are still a good value if you find a size that works for you. If they had just 1 size bigger, I believe that I would purchase these again.

  Most cotton shirts I find these days tend to be too thin, so as to hold the shirt up to a light and you can see light shining through the shirt. These ones are a thicker cotton shirt, which I like. When I was my t-shirts I don't through the in the dryer, trying to help them last longer. But one thing it does is makes them dry stiffer then if they were tumble dried in the dryer. I like that they feel like they are made of some substance when I put them on. I have not worn these yet, but I can tell by the feel, these will be the type of t-shirt I like to wear. I purchased black, which looks good with any pair of jeans. I purchased some other t-shirts at the same time to compare (different brand and different feel of cotton). Probably sending the other t-shirts back. I can see the light through the others I am sending back.

  Gildan Men's Ultra Cotton T-Shirt, Style G2000, Multipack (2).<br/><br/>I like Gildan products, I ordered two packs (4 shirts).  These are Ultra Cotton and after you wash them three or four times in warm or hot water and dry them in your dryer, they shrink a bit.  I wear a size medium and I ordered large.  They now have a slightly loose fit that is very comfortable while the hem is well below the belt line.  If you wear these for work and tuck them in, they will not show your backside when you bend over.<br/><br/>They seem to be durable like my older Gildan shirts and briefs.  There are no problems with the seams or stitching and all is holding up well after four washings.  These were new in un-opened packages.  Compared to the prices in retail stores for underwear, these are a real bargain.  I recommend these.

  Actually one of the better shirts I bought. I definitely recommend purchasing one size up from what you normally wear. I’m a former body builder so I’ve got broad shoulders, a big chest and normally wear a 2X but purchased a 3X per reviews from others recommending to do so. Fits generally good overall. Not the softest shirt I ever owned but I’ve had worse. The shirt is comfortable and not too thick and bulky like other shirts. I’ve got experience with these shirts and after a few washes they get more comfortable over time and last. I wear these shirts often and they’re comfortable to wear out on the town, doing yard work or just laying around the house in.

  Construction is consistent on the pair of t-shirts. They fit as expected. The cotton is heavy duty.  They were sewn in Honduras. Ordered the color ""Galapagos Blue"", a rich dark teal color that is well-represented in the item pics. It's a nice alternative to the standard powder blue and royal blue t-shirts probably already in one's collection. On a 5'10"" wearer the shirt bottom rests below the belt and above the thigh, which is good for someone who is modest and that when raising arms, doesn't want to reveal a belly or backside. There is ample length for tuck in, if you desire a neat appearance. Went with G2000 as a test to see how it compares to G5000 from a previous purchase. After a few washes I will update with final thoughts. Don't wear it out of the package, give it a wash to eliminate the new textile odor and fabric sizing. So far, so good!

  I first ordered the heather blue and realized the polyester feel was not what I wanted. I ordered the navy blue solid and the feel is no where near as soft as other 100% cotton t-shirts I purchased. But the main problem is the way the neck is cut. There is more of an opening in the back than the front. (no, the shirt was not put on backwards) It's almost as if the shirt was made backwards, though. The front pulls up too close to the neck and makes it feel ""choked.""  We have used this brand many times in the past and now are so disappointed, we probably will no longer purchase it.

  My wife recently got a Cricut machine so she can make her own shirt designs.  We bought these shirts as a trial and they fit great!  I am 6""0' and weigh 285 lbs.  I bought the 3XL size and they fit me perfect.  Not tight at all.  They are a little loose in the arms and belly area which is perfect for me.  I can move around freely in them, I don't feel constricted or feel the shirt tightening on my arms or waist when I move around, and yet they are not too baggy, either.  Perfect fit!  Please note that we have bought the Dark Heather gray color and also the Galapagos blue.  The Dark Heather gray still fit perfect after multiple washes (they have become my go-to shirts now!).  The Galapagos blue shirts did shrink in length a little after the first wash.  The arms are still comfortable but now they are a little shorter than I prefer, but I would still recommend the product.

  Ok I ordered a set of these shirts because finding 100% cotton shirts is getting harder in the village I live in.  I read the description and ordered a solid color which should be 100% cotton.  After I got them, washed them and wore the first shirt I knew they were not cotton... nope they are 10% polyester.  I cannot stand the way plastic feels nor do I care for how it does not breathe, hence why I look for pure cotton.<br/><br/>My advice would be skip this gamble and buy from someone that sells only 100% pure cotton shirts, not this color based content, seriously, different colors have different amounts of cotton and plastic?  Not cool.  Literally.

I am 6'6"" tall and the shirt is too short after I washed it shrunk up. Fit a little short initially but could wear it, length about 1 inch below belt line. After wash shrunk up a couple inches. After wash tested wearing shirt standing with arms down by my side bottom of shirt goes to belt line. With arms straight out at 90 degree angle bottom of shirt goes about 1 inch above belt line. With arms straight up bottom of shirt goes about 4 inches above belt line. The item does have a large amount of cotton which is known to shrink. But it is just too short for me to wear comfortably now. So I'm not wearing it because length too short and will probably toss it. What I really need is an XXL Tall/Long. Gildan does not seem to have tall options. That being said, it is not really the sellers fault or Gildans fault that I am really tall and bought an XXL regular. And I have since found a few XXL Tall shirts. Item arrived within 4 days.

  These shirts may be very old stock or perhaps a slightly different version than I'm used to or very good knockoffs. They have the exact same cut and fit as the Gildan shirts that I usually buy individually or in small packs, and the stitching and everything seems the same, but the material that the shirts are made out of is completely different, a much heavier and rougher feeling cotton. I do not like this material as much. Also these have tags instead of the label printed on the shirt, so there's definitely something different about these than the ones I usually get. I'll keep them because the shirts fit fine and they'll probably soften up over time. If you buy these just don't expect the usual soft cotton.

  I give this a 5/5 because it fit just as I needed them to. These are not my first Gildan shirts, I have bought some for work and they are still going strong. The fabric is thick, a tad on heavy side, so if you're looking for some shirts to cool down in, these are not it. You should get this shirts if you want them to last and also if you want to feel comfortable if you're on the big body size like I am. Also, these shirts are long enough to cover your big belly if you're on that boat. Be advised, heavy chemical smell, I would recommend washing them because after few minutes I started to get a mild headache. I will update if I have any negative experiences after few washes.<br/><br/>Edit: Lowered rating from 5 to 4 because the shirt shrunk in length after the first wash and dry.

  First off, I was looking to replace 6 t shirts. I found these and they were an OK price. Pretty good reviews.

I have never had t shirts that curl like them. I just dont think there is enough fabric at the ends to make them not curl.<br/><br/>Update: after 6 months, I am disappointed in these. They have done nothing but curl on the sleeves and bottoms. It is irritating. I am going to scrap these and go with some better quality tees<br/><br/>Other then the t shirt curl, these are not bad.

They have an excellent variety of colors from standard to very bright and they don't seem to fade easily. There is little shrinkage after washing and drying.

  I bought these and Gildan’s Hammer white t-shirts at the same time. Do yourself a favor and spend $5 more for the two pack of the Hammers. The Hammer line is thicker (less see through) and way softer. These ultra cottons are just regular Gildan t-shirts. Everyone needs to stop acting like they have never had a Gildan shirt that they got for free from somewhere (school, work, an event, DARE graduation…). These fit exactly like every Gildan t-shirt and they shrink up like EVERY Gildan t-shirt that I’ve had for the last 30 years.

  These shirts came in a timely manner and feel like they're great quality. Unfortunately, one of them had two noticeable stains on the front of the shirt. Even on a navy colored shirt, they were very easy to see. It almost looked like oil spots or something. This was straight out of the packaging.<br/><br/>The return policy for these seems weird and difficult to navigate. At one point, it was going to charge me nearly the entire cost of the product just to have the pleasure of returning them, which is absurd. I would avoid this product and seller. There are plenty other plain t-shirts to be found on Amazon.

  Good shirt. Good price. Quality seems very good. There is double stitching on the sleeves, bottom, and neck, and seams. Gives the impression of durability. Great for lounging around the house, or small trips around town. It does feel heavier than other t-shirts like Hanes or Fruit of the Loom, that are meant to be worn inside under the main shirt. I usually buy X-Large for other t-Shirts, but got Large for this shirt after checking out the sizing chart. Fit was good. These t-shirts do not look cheap...even though the price is. Value and quality.

  I bought these after my favorite heavy cotton T-shirts by Russell seem to have been discontinued, because I can't find them for sale anywhere these days. All they sell now is in large part polyester.<br/><br/>I got the black ones and they are 100% cotton according to the label. These T-shirts are not as heavy as I would like, but the weight is still OK. I would not go any lower than 6 oz though.<br/><br/>There is no vanity sizing here, small means small, so there is no need to adjust for the marketing department.<br/><br/>The fabric is not exactly soft, but also not really scratchy. I'm sure sensitive people will not like it. My first association when feeling it on my skin was linen.<br/><br/>Supposedly the tags can be torn off, which I have not tried yet. So far I can deal with them.<br/><br/>All in all it's a decent product and we'll see how long they last. The arguably better ones that I just replaced cost $70 for 10, these are $35 for 10. At that price there's really not much to argue.

  Size 2XL waist and chest are a just little on the loose side for my 40-inch waist and 47-inch chest.  Buts shoulders are very wide with seams that drop down my arms 2+ inches.  And the sleeve holes are a little larger than other t-shirts I have, including some older Gildan Ultra Cotton.  I'd say these would fit well on someone with a 48-50-inch chest, broad shoulders, and big biceps!  If you're between an XL and 2XL, get this shirt in size XL.  I think an XL would fit me perfectly across the shoulders, but might be a little tight across my waist and chest.  What I do like is the heavy cotton material and sleeve length, which is much better than the t-shirts now being sold in stores made of thin, clingy, man-made fabrics with ultra-short sleeves.

Fit and finish are great as are the materials used and the fit is just right. Little to no shrinkage when washed and they hold their color very well after multiple washings. Gildan is my go to brand now.<br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br/>One of the two shirts didn't survive the first initial washing. The bottom hem came unraveled and now it's just plain ugly.

  These are the cheap but sturdy t shirts we buy at Michaels for my son to wear while working on his car. Motor oil and grease don't show of course on black t shirts. I ordered from Amazon after not being able to get the size I needed from Michael's. The shipment came in quickly enough. The shirts feel heavy and are well sewn. I don't see any defects. The only con I see is that after washing in cold water with mild detergent, these shirts had a chemical odor. I don't know if it could be the dyeing process or what but the smell is quite strong. It reminds me of ant poison. After washing a second time in warm water and an odor removing liquid, I was able to get a diminished smell. We are going to toss these after my son works on changing his motor oil or work on his engine. I will probably try another order to see if this is just an odd occurance, since I do not see anyone else complaining.

  I’m 6 foot tall and barrel chested with broad shoulders and have always purchased 2X, but I found,  like most  all cotton clothing, repeated  washings and dryer cycles cause shrinkage, so I recommend going up a size or two if you prefer loose fitting apparel. These are well made, but better suited for less humid weather conditions,  given the thickness of the cotton material. I have another brand made of thinner cotton for brutally hot conditions.  I purchased 3X and I am very satisfied. These are very durable and well priced.

  These shirts are a good quality construction, they are not very soft, but they are durable. They are made for men with smaller arms, shoulders and slightly larger waist section, so basically if you are a normal weight for your height or slightly overweight man mostly carrying in the mid section, this should fit you very comfortably.  If you have larger arms or shoulders, or you work out, then you will find the sleeves very tight around the armpit, uncomfortably so.  Likewise, if you have a trim waist or are on the thin side, you will find the mid section of these shirts to be very loose, almost tent like.

  These shirts work well as both undershirts and t-shirts. The material is decently heavy and not see-through, and the fit is not too tight / loose / otherwise unflattering. When worn as an undershirt, they don't feel heavy or suffocating. On top of that, these are inexpensive and available in a number of colors. There is a tag in the back, which is designed to be torn off IIRC, but it hasn't bothered me at all. So far I haven't noticed any shrinkage from laundry.<br/><br/>I have also tried the Gildan DryBlend t-shirts. The material on the DryBlends is some kind of synthetic blend which is lighter. It's also a bit transparent, so more suitable as an undershirt and less as a t-shirt. Overall, I would say that I prefer the Ultra Cottons over the DryBlends for both usages. The quality of both seems to be good though.

  This is a good t-shirt for everyday wear. It is well-made and one should get many years of use from it.

  I purchased 6 of these tee shirts for summer wear and bought x-large to ensure a good fit.  After washing they all shrunk about two full sizes and were so tight I could not wear them, so I donated them.  It's a shame they shrunk so much because they are a really good quality shirt.  I would have bought 2X or 3X had I known they were going to shrink this much.  I don't want to run the risk of paying good money for 6 more shirts only to have them not fit.

Not the Same Gildan as I am Used To...
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  First, I must preface this review with the fact that I have been buying Gildan Ultra Cotton shirts for almost 10 years, and these shirts are nice, but not the same as I have previously purchased. My first impression was that the fabric is not as heavy as my previous shirts, and upon checking where they were made, it states that they were made in Nicaragua. I checked my older shirts and found that they were made in Honduras. I then tried the new shirts on, and found that they did not fit the same as my others, meaning, they were less roomy around the stomach, tighter across the shoulders, and not as long. All this in mind, I can’t give them a 5 star rating since they aren’t comparable to what I have become accustomed to. But, two shirts for 10 bucks are hard to pass up and I will keep them, just not buy these particular ones again.

  The stitching around the neck came undone after the third wash. I didn't expect much for the price but I did expect to wear them more than twice! Gildan used to make a nice t-shirt. Their quality sure isn't what it used to be. Not such a good deal if you can only wear them twice before you have to make rags out of them...

  Gildan is really good for getting a couple plain t-shirts that are decent. They don't feel paper-thin like a pack of Hanes undershirts; they're actually pretty thick and have a nice quality. They do fit kinda weird. The sleeves are very wide and look loose unless you have Hulk Hogan's pythons. They're a tiny bit longer than shirts of a similar size. I would recommend them. I mean, $8 for 2 decent shirts is hard to beat.

  I personally feel that Gildeon's black shirts look and feel better than the traditional white shirts. After washing and using for a month or two, they don't look as worn out or ""used"" as a white traditional shirt would look.<br/>I know this from experience and from buying this brand for over a few years now.<br/>Also, these shirts are far more comfortable than other brands --- or maybe its a mind thing. I don't know, but they feel softer. ha!

  I’m kind of on the chubbier side, so I always tend towards slightly thicker t shirts in a size larger, so it doesn’t fit snug around my waist.  This one, the material was very nice and soft and could be worn comfortably as an undershirt or a plain tshirt.  I particularly love the collar as it is high quality and strong.  I wear it all day to work and to run errands and the collar does not bend at all.  It shrinks very slightly after wash but is overall really good.

I have a pretty broad chest and little beef in my arms, this shirt fits me perfectly in the chest, however the arms and waist are like a parachute.<br/><br/>So I recommend the quality of this product and I can't knock them for design, just be aware of the sizing.<br/><br/>As a side note, I bought this product because I own Gildan boxers and boxer briefs and they're both spot on with sizing and quality.

  These shirts seem to be well enough constructed and are probably very comfortable if they fit your build. I originally bought a size up due to reviews about shrinkage. They didn't shrink that much so the XXL didn't fit. Second time around I bought my usual size, XL. This size was comfortable in the shoulders but reached halfway to my knees. In other words, these shirts appear tailored specifically to men with a narrow build. If you're athletic build or muscular, the cut will be either too tight in the chest and shoulders or too long. I'm not sure why Gildan designed them like this, as their sweatshirts fit me perfectly. Hey designers, not all men are 6' tall and 140lbs.

Match happier. Don't buy fruit of the loom or Hanes. These are so much better.

  These are decent all cotton t shirts that for some reason remind me of the way Hanes used to fit.  They are a little loose in the arms, but tighter up in the shoulders so they don't feel quite right.  I am 6' 1"" and about 215 with broad shoulders and this tends to be an issue for me, so I've tried a lot of different T shirts.<br/><br/>At this point I prefer the synthetic cotton blends as they tend to hold their size better after washing.  Being all cotton, these wear like the t's I used to buy 10 years ago, and have the same issues after washing.  I gave these a shot because of the price, and because my current favorite, Next Level, is a little tight in the guns for my liking.  I think I'd still stick to those at this point.<br/><br/>The search for perfection in a t shirt under 10 bucks continues.

  One of the shirts arrived a little dirty looking for some reason but I washed them before wearing. They are dark black and didn’t fade or shrink in the wash on both delicate/normal cycles with cold water. I was them often. The fabric is nice and durable, I’m sure they’ll last me awhile.<br/><br/>I am a female but I prefer men’s tshirts. In women’s and unisex shirts I’m a Medium size so I ordered a Small. They fit me pretty snug on the arms (I have big arms), but the rest of the shirt fit okay. I will order a Medium next time.<br/><br/>I would say they are pretty good quality for the price. Would buy again. I suggest ordering your unisex shirt size.

  The shirt was fine quality, it is a heavier cotton like it says. I bought a bunch of shirts to iron on a design for a party, they fit on the smaller side to begin with. We washed a Men’s XL just to see how much it would truly shrink. The picture shows the other shirt in the pack not washed, behind the shirt we washed. Sadly, the material is one that will most likely keep skrinking every wash. Might be okay if you line dry only. Hood for a cheap shirt to just have for a few wears, did not work as a shirt I want people to be able to have for a long time to wear.

  The XL size I ordered is actually about a Large, if that.

  With just one wash in warm water and then drying in a warm dryer this shirt shrank so much that it was too short, too tight in the chest, and too tight at the arms.  This is a poor product due to its problems with overall quality.  Most shirts, even 100% cotton don't normally shrink this much unless the cotton is poorly processed.  I would not buy any more of this product by this company. I am 66 inches tall and weigh 145 lbs.  The medium shirt was way too small after one washing.

  These t-s are the best heavy- (but not too heavy!) weight all cotton shirts I have ever found, and you cannot beat the price. Nice heft, they are nonetheless soft, hang well and don't cling, yet are classically, perfectly cut. These things launder really well, too. They hold the heft forever; I have one of these t's that is a good 10 years old and it has held the color and body ever since. Perfect when you need an opaque, full coverage, heavier t that breathes well. Genuinely worth it at double + the price.

  I scoured Amazon researching T-Shirts. Apparently a great many famous brands have declined in quality over the years. I ordered Gildan based on the reviews. Just got these this week. The thickness and weight of the fabric, and the way the shirts fit are a cut above many of the other T-Shirts I've collected over the years. We'll see about durability and how they fit and feel after multiple washings, but for right now, they're great. If you're looking for a casual shirt for workouts, dog walking, home projects or heading to the hardware store, give these a try.

  I haven't washed these shirts yet, so I cannot comment on their softness yet.  However, upon wearing them right out of the package, I would say that they are slightly scratchy feeling and not super-soft as advertised.  I expect, nevertheless, that after they are washed with fabric softener (perhaps even without) that they will be very soft.  One thing is for certain:  they are very well constructed.  I'm not unhappy even though they do not have the silky smooth texture I was expecting right out of the package.  I am exprcted a better feeling once they have been washed.

  These are pretty good undershirts but thin. I am very picky and used to the heavy Carhartt shirts. I do not like thin shirts, so these are on the edge for me. I would call them a light/medium weight shirt. I will bite the bullet and order the heavy expensive ones from now on to wear in the warm months,  but these will suffice to wear under a long sleeve shirt in the cooler months.

  As of the date of this review, the description describes this shirt as being 100% cotton.

  these 100% cotton T's (white) are almost like they are from a lost era. Much more substantial than I've seen in years. Not as soft as flimsy stuff you get from low end retailers, but I expect that with subsequent washings they will soften up.  Shrinkage is at predicted rate for high quality cotton so the end result in my case was the expected XL.

  They are good for the price. They are a little scratchy but that goes away after washing it once or twice. The only thing I don't like about these shirts is that they have the standard neck tag that needs to be cut out and in both arm pits of the shirt there is a bunch of left over string that will hang out and bug you if you don't cut it but overall those aren't big issues and I would buy again if I needed to.

  Certainly cannot complain about the price, but after decades wearing JCPenney's Stafford premium heavyweight cotton T's, these Gildan Men's Ultra Cotton Adult T-Shirts still are a disappointment.  Penny's was out of stock, so I ordered the Gildans.  They were flagged ""#1 Best Seller,"" but they are certainly not #1 best.  Made of a lightweight cotton fabric, after washing they are noticeably smaller. Also, the laundered seams shrunk and puckered in places, so they do not fit nice. I should have ordered the large size to end up with medium. Perhaps they will survive ten washings.

  I'm a pretty thick on the waist right now, so it's more tight for me around the midsection as a result. This shirt seems to fit better on fit people.

Over the past couple of years I have managed to dirty up practically every white shirt that I have so I decided, why not gray? These shirts fit great and are comfortable to wear. After 2 washes it looks as thought have shrunk a little bit, but not much at all which is a relief. Would definitely recommend them for a casual, comfy shirt!

  This is the 3rd time I've ordered a 2-pack of these.<br/><br/>I did one order in 4x and the other 2 in 5x and either would have been fine. (6'1-295). I've seen regular t-shirts with thin material that shrinks cost three times as much for 4x-5x sizes.<br/><br/>These shirts are way better quality than I would have expected, barely shrunk after washing, and fit great. I need something comfortable for work and would have paid more if I had to but it was nice that I didn't

  The product advertised that it was ultra cotton material, leaving you to believe it was going to be very soft material.  The material felt very rough out of the package, washed them using extra softener in hopes of softening them up but it didn’t make a difference.  So don’t purchase if you are looking for a nice weight soft Cotten T-shirt….

  I bought these primarily to wear under a long sleeved shirt, so I'm not concerned with the wrinkle factor or the looks.  My build usually puts me between a Medium and Large, so I usually purchase shirts sized Large. To me these definitely fit like a large.  My only comment is that they are a little thicker/heavier/stiffer(?) than most t-shirts I've previously purchased, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but surprising.  Hopefully it means they'll last longer.

  These T-shirts are OK for knockin' around the house, but the cotton isn't all that soft and they come out of the dryer really wrinkled. The biggest thing they have going for them is price, at about four and a half bucks per shirt. Personally, I prefer Amazon Essentials T-shirts, which are softer, come out of the dryer far less wrinkled, and cost just a little more at about six bucks a shirt. The Gildan shirts aren't bad, but I won't be ordering more of them.

  Gildan is the go-to t-shirt for wearing as both an undergarment and as an additional layer.<br/><br/>Not crazy about the very thin, very soft, body-hugging t-shirts that are widespread and popular now?  Find that they wear out quickly, stretch easily out of shape, do nothing but (barely) cover your skin?<br/><br/>Gildan makes a heavy, 100% cotton t-shirt that is durable, color-fast, and holds it's shape.

  I was looking to replace some red heathered Mossimo Athletic Fit T-Shirts that I really liked, which apparently they no longer make. Compared to those, the sleeves on these just don't fit nicely; the ends are to wide and they flop around a bit instead of following the curve of the arm. The color is much brighter than the picture which looks to me almost maroon. I got the Antique Cherry Red, and I guess the red does indeed look like a bright artificial cherry red lipstick, with black specs. The threading is in a lighter shade of red, and the overall effect is just blech. Unlike the picture, this also has a white tag on the inside back of the collar, which the Mossimo shirts don't (they have a tagless label). I always have to remove such tags, which sometimes damages the shirt. I ended up returning the 2-pack.

  Not sure what happened with these but not at all the standard I'm used to from this company. The fit is just strange and the material is scratchy and thin. The chest fits very loose at the armpits and leaves these deep wrinkles on the sides of your chest and it creates these protrusions on the back of your shirt at the shoulder blades. It almost feels like it's on backwards. The collar feels fine and the waist fits to size, if not just a bit shorter than I'd like. Very let down by these overall as I was expecting much higher quality.

Probably a software glitch but watch your invoices.  I ordered the shirts from another site and the fit and quality are pretty good.  I use them for work and they hold up pretty well.

Terrible 'muscle shirt' design / fit
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Like a lot of other manufacturers, Gildan has started designing their shirts to be tight / athletic shaped in the chest and shoulders. This is a terrible idea and doesn't work. It just makes it look like I'm trying to wear a muscle shirt, and gives a weird, sharp, tight, angular shape to my shoulders and traps. They should ditch this terrible idea and just go back to having normally shaped, neutral-fitting shirts.

  The sizing for the 5xl is very accurate. They are fairly thick and good quality as far as T-shirts go these days. They are a little thicker than a regular Hanes T-shirt- reminds me more of their Beefy T-shirts. They don’t shrink much either which is a plus for big guys! My hubby is very happy with these:)

  I purchased these shirts because of the price first of all, and because of the quality of the shirts described from what I read in the reviews. I am very pleased with the shirts. I read in the comments that the shirt would shrink a bit after a wash so I was prepared for that. I bought a size larger than what I would normally get. Which is what I normally do when buying shirts. I would recommend the same. I am 5' 10"", 160lbs and I bought a size L. After a wash in some cold water and some drying, the shirt fits me perfect for how I like my shirts to be. The color is just fine as well. I washed it a couple of times now and the black has not faded one bit. Great shirts!

  I wanted  it to  fit loosely so I ordered the next size up.  I think that I probably should have ordered my regular size.  Once I washed and dried it, it fit better and still quite loose so I'm happy with my choice.  I wish the fabric was a little softer and for summer wear, a little lighter.  In cooler weather, this shirt will be perfect.  It seems well-made and likely to last a long time.  Great for the low price.  Before washing, I soaked in cold water - several times as lots of dye ran out.  Didn't affect the shirt, though.  It's still as deeply colored as before washing it.

  I REALLY like these shirts and for the price they are great deal and they fit as expected. I got the XXL and there may have been some slight shrinkage but still very good...i like my shirts very loose and these were perfect.<br/><br/>The neck line holds well AND these shirts are actually pretty thick for cotton tshirts.

  Gildan Ultra-cotton is one of the best tshirts on the market ( in my opinion).  I am 5""10 180-185 and the extra-large fits me perfect.  The shirt is well made with very nice seams, color fastness and overall durability.  I have experienced no shrinking after washing and drying.  Just a great shirt

  Bought these shirts because I own a number of the same brand, style, fabric, etc. But the neck hole (what do you call that on  a t-shirt with no collar?) is about 20% smaller than the shirts I have. Measured that much smaller. Not a function of old shirts sagging, stretching or simply aging. The circumference of the neck hole is just that much smaller. Makes the shirt uncomfortable &amp; looks funny. My wife noticed it instantly as soon as I put the shirt on. So, I'm not a happy customer.

  I purchased these for my dad for Christmas. I ended up keeping them because they were too small for him. He’s tall and they were too short. Even the sleeves seem small on me. Still happy with the quality overall - and would buy them again if they were for me.

  Very disappointed in these t-shirts. Bought to wear as pajama tops but the fabric is so rough, scratchy, and stiff that they'll have to be used as work shirts only. I even considered cutting them up to use as rags, the fabric is that unpleasant. I've had some Gildan shirts over the years that I've loved for their comfort and durability, but these are NOT that. I'd send them back if it didn't seem like more hassle than it's worth. Just gonna eat the $10 this time.

  I wasn't sure what to expect from a $6 t-shirt, my expectations were fairly low, and when they arrived the shape looked a bit too large with the sleeves a bit too short. However, after putting it on, those doubts were only in my mind.  It's exactly the size I was expecting -when I ordered it, sleeves were the right fit, and it's a heck of a lot better t-shirt than the cheap ones I normally buy, and these cost even less.

  Shirts are not of the same quality as a Gildan Ultra Cotton I already own. These are of a lighter material (not as thick). The tags are not the same as my original. These appear to be cheaply screened. Maybe knock-offs? Will still keep them. For $5 each, they're still nice enough to wear. I just don't know how well they'll hold up and if the color (black) will fade.

  When I received these tees I was very happy with the fit and since they were pre-shrunk I did not expect any problems. After the first washing (in cold water) they have shrunken to the point that they are unwearable. If you do order these order larger than you need because they will definitely shrink!

  I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8"" and 140"", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked.<br/><br/>I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.<br/><br/>Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.<br/><br/>Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.<br/><br/>Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.<br/><br/>I hope that this review is helpful to you.<br/><br/>Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer.  Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.<br/><br/>I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out.  I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however,  I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.<br/><br/>I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.<br/><br/>Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.<br/><br/>June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.<br/><br/>September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.<br/><br/>November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them.  They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.<br/><br/>November 28, 2020 -  I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.<br/><br/>March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.<br/><br/>September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.

  My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.

  I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.<br/><br/>I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.<br/><br/>I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.<br/><br/>FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.<br/><br/>GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.<br/><br/>VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.<br/><br/>UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.<br/><br/>SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.

  I’m a big girl. 5’3” and 250 lbs. I usually wear XL or XXL because sizes are so inconsistent. These shirts are a true XL! They fit my chest without pulling up too much in the front. They aren’t too snug but don’t look loose and frumpy either. The material is thick and even though they might shrink a bit in the wash, there’s enough room that they still won’t be too small. I’ll definitely be buying these again.

  Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.<br/><br/>So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.<br/><br/>Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.<br/><br/>A great find!

  These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.

  Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like. I am a throw it in the laundry and go type so I needed bigger so I could shrink it. I am 250 lbs and 5'11 with a beer gut. I got the 2x and it fit just a touch too big and after 1 wash it is perfect. After a few more washes I might have wished on a 3x but not sure yet. As of now they are perfect and am happy. Only thing that will change when I order more is color and  possible size upgrade if it continues to shrink.

  The fabric on this shirt is very stiff, even after washing. I bought these for undershirts and they're way too thick and stiff to be worn under another shirt.

  My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.

  I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.<br/><br/>I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.<br/><br/>I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.<br/><br/>FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.<br/><br/>GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.<br/><br/>VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.<br/><br/>UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.<br/><br/>SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.

  I’m a big girl. 5’3” and 250 lbs. I usually wear XL or XXL because sizes are so inconsistent. These shirts are a true XL! They fit my chest without pulling up too much in the front. They aren’t too snug but don’t look loose and frumpy either. The material is thick and even though they might shrink a bit in the wash, there’s enough room that they still won’t be too small. I’ll definitely be buying these again.

  Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.<br/><br/>So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.<br/><br/>Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.<br/><br/>A great find!

  These are nice, medium weight t-shirts, not the thin, cheap kind.  They are a little small compared to his other brand t-shirts but the color is bright.  My husband usually wears XL t-shirts but I bought in 2XL since they are 100% cotton and I expected some shrinkage with washing.  They fit him OK before washing but were slightly short in the body.  After washing, they fit still OK and there wasn't any noticeable shrinkage.  I washed in cold water to prevent bleeding of colors and excessive shrinking.  I also pulled it out of the dryer after 10 minutes, while still damp, and hung it up in my laundry room to complete drying and prevent wrinkles.  He is happy with the shirts and I will probably buy more in different colors for him.

  Great Shirt... Always subject to what the wife brings home I finally wanted to find something more my speed. This shirt is thicker than your typical T which is why I like. I am a throw it in the laundry and go type so I needed bigger so I could shrink it. I am 250 lbs and 5'11 with a beer gut. I got the 2x and it fit just a touch too big and after 1 wash it is perfect. After a few more washes I might have wished on a 3x but not sure yet. As of now they are perfect and am happy. Only thing that will change when I order more is color and  possible size upgrade if it continues to shrink.

Quality is somewhat poor, but it's okay as a value product
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  While it isn't necessarily true that you get what you pay for, this is definitely one of those cases. This T-shirts are cheap, in more than one way. The fabric is 100% cotton, but a coarse, rough cotton, and the cut is slightly awkward. The fabric is not especially thin, probably a little thicker than most shirts I've worn, but the seams fold over themselves more than most shirts. Overall lower in quality than the bulk Gildan shirts I've worn.<br/><br/>However, it's not uncomfortable, and the sizing or the shape isn't abnormal enough that it looks weird on me. Despite its flaws, it should considered decent as a value T-shirt, and is certainly acceptable for many people; however, those looking for good quality should consider more expensive options.<br/><br/>(Size purchased: medium; on a male height 5'9, weight 160 lb, fit is as expected)

  These Gildan T-shirts are just the right fit for me. And, being a little on the ""hefty"" side, that's not an easy task.<br/><br/>I buy the 3X sizes and they're just right: not too tight, not too big. I would describe them as a little loose-fitting on me, but I prefer that. So, if you like a tight fit and you're in between sizes, you may want to opt for the smaller size. Otherwise, they fit just fine. During this pandemic, I've spent more time than I care to admit in ""PJs"" as I now work from home, and I like these shirts so much that I've repurchased them several times in different colors. I really like that you can get so many different color combinations.<br/><br/>As for strength of materials, of all these shirts I've purchased (probably over 20), I've never had a shirt rip or tear. I'd definitely recommend these T-shirts. They do the job and at a reasonable price.

  ***UPDATE 6/19/2019***<br/>I've only had the shirts for about 6 months and both have shrunk and faded significantly. The neck collars have rolled up. I bought these Gildan Dry-blend shirts and the fit is much better, perfect thickness on the shirt itself: (https://www.amazon.com/Gildan-DryBlend-Workwear-T-Shirts-XX-Large/dp/B07CX3XMFT/ref=pd_yo_rr_rp_2/141-5517899-8468140?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07CX3XMFT&amp;pd_rd_r=51dfdb89-fe12-47f6-bec1-66f0dbc9851e&amp;pd_rd_w=p22dQ&amp;pd_rd_wg=Jt0Xi&amp;pf_rd_p=5b2bffa6-877f-4dbd-a411-9578bf4fd009&amp;pf_rd_r=8EMXACPZBHN110PMNXFN&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=8EMXACPZBHN110PMNXFN).

Even the Gildan shirts that I got in a multi pack lasted much longer. If you're a bigger man looking for long lasting undershirts, get the Dryblend shirts or 5 pack instead.<br/><br/>Original Review:<br/><br/>If you ever used Stafford undershirts from JCPenney then you'll love these! I've searched everywhere for years for black midweight undershirts close to the ones JCPenney used to sell. And I am so glad I gave these from Gildan a shot! The fit is perfect and the shirts aren't see through. They do a good job of hiding your skin! I bought a multipack of undershirts from Gildan but these are definitely thicker! They also last quite a while! No issues with armpit seams tearing of hems rolling up. Great for self-conscious Big &amp; Tall men! I will definitely be ordering more!

  I bought these to wear under a shirt or sweater with the neck showing.<br/><br/>The Good: They are long enough which is a problem for some colored T-shirts.  The material is about average thickness.  I have some nicer T-Shirts that are a bit thicker, but I've seen thinner material T-shirts too.  The material is softness is about average.  For the price, they're decent thickness and soft enough.  You'd have to spend much more money to get better.<br/><br/>The Bad: These fit weird.  The sleeves flare out which I've never seen in a T-Shirt before.  Also, the shoulders are too wide; the shoulder line is past my shoulder.  I've never had this problem with any other T-Shirt ever.  The neck is a bit loose.  I was hoping from other reviews that the neck would lay flat.  Though I've seen looser, I can't say these lay flat.

Gildan White G2000 not made like the Gray G2000 'T' shirts.
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Since the Stay-At-Home deal some of us have gained a little weight, so, to keep up with my body type I purchased a bunch of  Gray G2000 'T' shirts. These gray shirts looked and fit great even after machine washing. I decided to buy a bunch of white G2000 'T' shirts to tie-dye. The Gildan White G2000 aren't made like the Gray G2000 'T' shirts.  The gray were a heavier grade cotton, with better stitching et cetera.  So, I thought that I'd get some of the same type in White.  I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the shirts that I received, not only were they of cheaper quality cotton, synthetic thread was used to stitch to shirt which shows up like a spot light (when tie-dyed)because (of course) synthetic thread will not take up Procion MX dye.  If the shirt description states 100% cotton the shirt should be 100% cotton, otherwise the description should state that the shirt stitching is synthetic and not 100% cotton. There should be no difference in quality of materials between the 2 colors of shirts but there was. The difference in a tie-dye between a quality white shirt and the Gilda G2000 is night and day. I feel 'sullied and unclean' for having used the White G2000 'T' shirts. One can be sure that I will no longer use the Gildan product even to clean the floor.<br/>So, no i'm not happy with this product at all. Each time I wear one of these shirts i'll be reminded of my disappointment when I see the sleeve, neck and tail stitching.

  Just got my first 2 pack, no holes or damage or major irregularities.  Washed them and dried them on high.  I'm 5'10"" and thin and bought medium and they fit *pretty much* as expected, after a little normal shrinkage which I also expected.  I've got a fairly normal torso length and the bottom sits roughly 4 inches below the top of my pants, which I wear a bit low on my waist.  Any longer and I'd say it was too long but I can just reach in my front and back pockets without the shirt really getting in the way which is nice and I don't look like I'm wearing some kind of ladies night shirt.  Thickness is what I'd consider decent mid-weight for a t-shirt.  Not remarkably thick or heavy but definitely not light or thin.  I'd expect them to last a good while of active service as long as the stitching stays good.  Sleeves are fairly standard if not on the short side but nothing to an unusual degree or worth complaining about.  Arm holes also pretty on point, not to big, not bunching in the arm pits.  The neck hole seems a touch on the small side, ok for me as I have a skinny neck, and again not extreme enough that it seems way off base or anything.  Only real complaint is it seems to have an odd cut that's kind of hard to describe like the front is bigger than the back.  Like if you stand up perfectly straight with your shoulders back and really puff out your chest and almost arch your back the front of the shirt hangs normal, but if you have a relaxed posture the neck kind of rides up the front of your neck a bit and there's unusual bagginess in the chest and belly.  And no my posture's not perfect and yes I am skinny, but 45 years of wearing t-shirts I can say this one hangs a bit weird.  Not even like it's designed for someone with perfect posture and an athletic build, more like it's designed for someone with a flat back and front side like a barrel.  And if you hold it up by the shoulder seams or hang it similarly on a hanger the front isn't longer than the back so it's like the front is somehow wider or rounder than the back.  And it does seem to be snug on the front of your neck while the back of the neck and loose and has an odd wrinkle whether you stand up like there's a rod in your spine or not.  One has the odd wrinkly bit in the back neck area when folded fresh out of the dryer and one folds flat and normal so perhaps not the strictest manufacturing tolerances.  It's not too extreme so hoping some wearing, maybe manually stretching it out somehow, and washing cycles will break it more normal.<br/>Fairly satisfied but not really over the moon.  If they weren't so cheap and everything else on the market wasn't such trash I'd likely be a lot less satisfied.  It's decent quality fabric, which you would think would be fairly standard, it used to be, but is worthy of remark now that cheap garbage has become the norm. And has a slightly odd cut, but not quite odd enough to make it intolerable.<br/><br/>Specifics in case the listing changes:<br/>Gildan Men's Ultra Cotton T-Shirt, Style G2000, 2-Pack, Charcoal, Medium<br/>Sold by: Amazon.com Services LLC

  The shirts were such a good price and had good reviews so I took a gamble on them. I ordered a two pack of the blue and a two pack of the green.<br/><br/>Ordered the 2XL and the shirts fit great when they arrived. I decided to go ahead and order two more in grey.<br/><br/>Turns out I should have waited to order the grey shirts till I washed the first ones a few times.<br/><br/>The Blue and Green shirts shrank about an inch to an inch and a half in the dryer. I only wear them around the house now. They are now too short, they fit as long as I don’t raise my arms at all.<br/><br/>The Grey shirts have held up better. When I wash them I hang them up to dry and so far they haven’t shrunk any. I have washed them a couple of times at this point.<br/><br/>My conclusion and experience so far is they are good cheap shirts that fit as long as you never put them in the dryer.

  Most of the pictures don't do this shirt justice. I unfortunately have gyno from puberty, most t shirts are paper thin and show everything off, these do not. With the black or navy blue gildan shirt no one can see anything. These are my favorite shirts, they are cheap, cotton, they hide everything, they are thick and wear nice.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that like all tshirts they are too short, and if not careful you will show your back when bending over.<br/><br/>Another thing that I REALLY love about these shirts is that the neck hole is tight and doesn't stretch out like a lot of thin tshirts. That's a huge pet peeve for me.<br/><br/>I have tried walmart shirts and they all suck IMO, this is the shirt I trust. I think if you take a chance on these shirts you will like them. That being said remember these shirts will shrink over time, that's just the nature of cotton, it's unavoidable, but IMO these shirts look and feel better with age.

These are an addition to the other Gildan shirts in his closet.++update++ washing and putting in the dryer resulted in shrinkage which is to be expected with 100% cotton, but going forward with these shirts and with the others that I'm waiting on, I will be hanging to dry. The softness seems to have disappeared as well. They were so soft until being washed. Now, it's just like any other random t shirt out there. A bit disappointed 😞

  I used to get St Johns Bay colored t shirts at Penneys which I wear as overshirts in the summer.  There are two things I consider musts:  No pocket (uncomfortable and useless) and 100% cotton.  But lately they seem to only have 60% cotton 40% synthetic.  It's easy to get 100% cotton white t shirts in the underwear department, why don't they use the same material for colored t shirts?  I have no idea.<br/><br/>I have quite a few of the ones from Penneys but not all the colors I would like.  So I got a couple of 2 packs of these to give them a try.  Note that if you want 100% cotton you have to be careful to choose the colors that are indicated as being 100% cotton and not synthetic blend.<br/><br/>They do have labels, but not too big a deal just cut them off as other people have suggested.  What concerned me more is that the cloth feels more coarse than that of the t shirts I am used to.  The whole reason I only get 100% cotton is that I am especially sensitive to discomfort in my clothing. (it's hell if I get a little fragment of a piece of popcorn under my t shirt)<br/><br/>But I was pleasantly surprised that these are virtually as comfortable as the all cotton T shirts I already have that use what I guess is a higher thread count material.  In addition, the neck fits perfectly.  The Penneys ones fit pretty well, but some didn't quite feel like a perfect fit.  Another point- they will probably get even a bit softer after they have been washed a few times.  But one washing (I always wash new clothes before wearing) is enough for these to be comfortable.<br/><br/>As to shrinkage that some customers mentioned.  I got medium just like the ones I got from Penneys.  They may be just a tad bit tighter coming out of the dryer.  However, pretty close to the same.  I don't find shirts comfortable if they are tight to my skin, so with T shirts, when I put one on, I always stretch it a bit with my hands so they don't hug my stomach or arms.  After doing this, the shirt fit just fine.  And they should be even better after I lose a few pounds which I have got to do.<br/><br/>The other good thing about these is that they are cheap.  They are fairly light weight but to me that's a plus since I get them to wear in the hot season of the year.<br/><br/>So, bottom line, for me these are keepers.  I will probably buy another 1 or 2 two-packs.<br/><br/>I was going to give these 4 stars but I am so picky and these meet so many of my finicky requirements that I figure they've earned 5 stars.

As Described By Seller
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  These two shirts came as described. I did order one size higher than I normally would and I regret that as after washing these are still too large to wear out and about. I buy my shirts large and long for comfort reasons so usually a 2xl after washing is perfect comfort wise, so I bought 3xl this purchase based on all the reviews. I can use them for around the house but I won't be wearing them out anywhere. For the price though I'm not really that upset. I may even buy another set a size smaller and see. The pink is like an 80's neon pink btw. The thickness is right in the middle of light and thick. They are pretty soft after one wash considering the thickness but they aren't like 30 washes soft. Just not stiff thankfully. Also, these did not run at all when I washed them. I wouldn't recommend pushing your own luck like I did but just as an FYI I was shocked that none of my other clothes turned pink, even my white tank.<br/>So for just about $8 total with tax included this was still a deal for two tee's IMO.

High expectations

  I bought these black shirts for my bf and had high expectations due to all the positive reviews.  However,  I was quickly disappointed because the shirt, fresh out the package, had white stuff on it. My bf is very detail oriented and brought it to me showing the white crap. What is it? And why it is on a brand new shirt out the plastic??<br/><br/>Also my bf is 6'2 and the shirt is too short as it hits above the belt. So anytime he reaches for something or just raises his arms up,  the shirt goes way up, exposing his stomach.<br/><br/>I think I'll stick with Kingstead shirts from now on. Even though they are more expensive, they have better quality, clean and ready to wear out the package and fits him perfectly where it falls below the belt.

Gildan shirts have definitely changed....

<span>
  As my title suggests, Gildan product has changed. I bought about 220 shirts (custom printed) for my business years ago, and those shirts have still maintained their size.<br/>The newer Gildan shirts either lose their size within a couple of washes, or their color. Sometimes both.<br/>These specific shirts, lost their color at two washes.<br/>These are build more robustly than the G5000 I bought here on Amazon, and have retained 80% of their size. They did shrink a little bit after they’ve been washed and dried, I give em a stretch before putting them on. I use them for work so they don’t need to be perfect.<br/>So that all said, I do recommend them if it’s more important to keep its size over its color.<br/>You won’t get both.<br/>I’ve been looking and buying, trying to find ones that offer both. Gildan just doesn’t seem to be the one for that.<br/>I’ll add that years ago I bought some some Michael’s on a sale they had and they had both size retention and their color lasted months of washing and drying. I may try them again.<br/>There ya have it. Good luck!

  The shirt is not as I expected, I am 5ft 5in and about 145lbs, I am a female so I ordered the large hoping for an oversized fit and was pretty disappointed. The shirt is almost fitting, barely loose on the chest and waist, the shirt is a good lasting quality but it is very rough. The material is a bit irritating even after washing with fabric softener, I would recommend to possibly size up and if you are particular about the feel of the material like me, this is not the one for you.

Uncomfortable shirts. Feel like the sleeves are on backward
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  Right off: If I had tried them on before laundering, I would have returned these shirts.<br/><br/>They are so uncomfortable. I got an XL because I don't like tight shirts. These have enough room in the body, but if your body doesn't completely fill out the shirt (which would make it fairly snug), it does not hang right, so it feels like the sleeves are on backward. Like this: If I have my arms straight down, it's fine; and if I move my arm backward, it's fine; but if I raise my arm forward, it immediately pulls taut on the sleeve because I don't have a huge chest pushing the front of the shirt way out.<br/><br/>I've been wearing XLs for a while and I've only experienced this kind of cut once, with a Hanes T-shirt. I guess if I was bigger it would make things line up properly, but then the shirt would also feel too small. I have other shirts from this brand but this cut is much different.<br/><br/>They run a little on the short side, which is another reason I went with XL.<br/><br/>That said: The material is really good - heavy and you can tell it will last. If you wear them more fitted, they'll probably be OK for you.

  The quality is really lacking (I’ve noticed a decline in product quality over the years).  After sever uses this product starts to come apart at the seams, many loose hanging threads, over stretched neck line (collar).  Again like so many other brands, the tee shirt sleeve are not long enough, the overall tee shirt quickly loses its fresh, new appearance and becomes another old “around the house” work shirt.  I guess in today’s market there are very few true quality products available to the general consumer.  My suggestion is to compare prices and take a chance on the competitors product, it may surprise you in being better quality at a cheaper price.  Brand named definitely don’t mean better products these days, it means they can command top dollar for equal or less equal product quality.

Disappointed-Gildan no longer makes nice shirts. Bad fit, rough fabric, not worth cheap price
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  I do not understand all the high ratings for these shirts.  These fit oddly and poorly. The neck is loose, the shoulder seams are spaced way too far apart (as if made for the shoulders of someone 4 sizes larger than XL--and I do have broad shoulders), the armpits have too much fabric &amp; are baggy, the arm holes are too big, the part over the torso and waist is not generously cut.  The main part of this shirt (the part over your abdomen and waist) is seamless--no side seams. That might explain the odd cut.  I have many older Gildan t-shirts that fit more normally, and made of soft cotton. I previously tried the slightly lighter-weight current version, and it was incredibly thin, but also fit terribly. This model has heavier fabric, but the fit is unusable and the fabric is rough and not soft. I compared this t-shirt to six older t-shirts that I already own--all acquired from different places and made by various companies, including Gildan.  This one is far worse than my others, and the lousy fit is my biggest reason for sending them back.  At one time, I thought Gildan made great t-shirts, but after I tried several current models and colors and was disappointed, I am giving up on this company, and will try another brand.

  We love these shirts. I've purchased so many for my husband over the years. They're so comfortable and soft but still a nice thick cotton (my husband hates thin cotton shirts 😂). They wash nicely and don't shrink much if at all. They're great for using on Cricut projects (ironing on patches, vinyl etc). My husband buys a size large and he is 5'8-9 and weighs roughly 175 pounds and has a longer torso so he loves that this fully cover his mid section and doesn't ride up as much as normal shirts do. Very happy with these shirts!

  I've never had a problem with Gildan t-shirts as far as the brand before, no matter where I purchased them from - their quality has always been great and they last.  Wish I could say the same for the shirts I received in this order.  I haven't even had these shirts 4 months and each has only been worn 2-3 times and already they're so stretched out you'd think I'd had them for years and worn/washed them over a hundred times.  The bottoms of both t-shirts have stretched out and they resemble maternity shirts when worn now.  I have other Gildan brand t-shirts in the same color that I purchased elsewhere that are several years old that don't even look this bad.  I'm not sure if this was a bunk batch, if Gildan product has gone downhill, or if somehow these weren't true Gildan at all and maybe were some knock off brand.  Unfortunately, by the time I wore each of these a few times and noticed that they were already wearing out, the return window had passed.

  These seem like a good value for the money. There are better deals for sure on shirts like these, but none of the better deals have shirts for the larger man. They usually all stop at 2x, with a few offering 3 or 4x. It is hard to find good low priced shirts in larger sizes. It is hit and miss as to how well they run true to size. These were tighter by far than other brands of the same size. Forget the fact of how it was after the first wash...  I ended up retiring these to be used for automotive rags. I am in no way saying these are not good shirts, on the contrary, they were very well constructed and super comfortable. They were just smaller than expected. If you find a size that works for you, don't hesitate, as these are still a good value if you find a size that works for you. If they had just 1 size bigger, I believe that I would purchase these again.

  Most cotton shirts I find these days tend to be too thin, so as to hold the shirt up to a light and you can see light shining through the shirt. These ones are a thicker cotton shirt, which I like. When I was my t-shirts I don't through the in the dryer, trying to help them last longer. But one thing it does is makes them dry stiffer then if they were tumble dried in the dryer. I like that they feel like they are made of some substance when I put them on. I have not worn these yet, but I can tell by the feel, these will be the type of t-shirt I like to wear. I purchased black, which looks good with any pair of jeans. I purchased some other t-shirts at the same time to compare (different brand and different feel of cotton). Probably sending the other t-shirts back. I can see the light through the others I am sending back.

These are Ultra Cotton and after you wash them three or four times in warm or hot water and dry them in your dryer, they shrink a bit.  I wear a size medium and I ordered large.  They now have a slightly loose fit that is very comfortable while the hem is well below the belt line.  If you wear these for work and tuck them in, they will not show your backside when you bend over.<br/><br/>They seem to be durable like my older Gildan shirts and briefs.  There are no problems with the seams or stitching and all is holding up well after four washings.  These were new in un-opened packages.

  Actually one of the better shirts I bought. I definitely recommend purchasing one size up from what you normally wear. I’m a former body builder so I’ve got broad shoulders, a big chest and normally wear a 2X but purchased a 3X per reviews from others recommending to do so. Fits generally good overall. Not the softest shirt I ever owned but I’ve had worse. The shirt is comfortable and not too thick and bulky like other shirts. I’ve got experience with these shirts and after a few washes they get more comfortable over time and last. I wear these shirts often and they’re comfortable to wear out on the town, doing yard work or just laying around the house in.

  Construction is consistent on the pair of t-shirts. They fit as expected. The cotton is heavy duty.  They were sewn in Honduras. Ordered the color ""Galapagos Blue"", a rich dark teal color that is well-represented in the item pics. It's a nice alternative to the standard powder blue and royal blue t-shirts probably already in one's collection. On a 5'10"" wearer the shirt bottom rests below the belt and above the thigh, which is good for someone who is modest and that when raising arms, doesn't want to reveal a belly or backside. There is ample length for tuck in, if you desire a neat appearance. Went with G2000 as a test to see how it compares to G5000 from a previous purchase. After a few washes I will update with final thoughts. Don't wear it out of the package, give it a wash to eliminate the new textile odor and fabric sizing. So far, so good!

  I first ordered the heather blue and realized the polyester feel was not what I wanted. I ordered the navy blue solid and the feel is no where near as soft as other 100% cotton t-shirts I purchased. But the main problem is the way the neck is cut. There is more of an opening in the back than the front. (no, the shirt was not put on backwards) It's almost as if the shirt was made backwards, though. The front pulls up too close to the neck and makes it feel ""choked.""  We have used this brand many times in the past and now are so disappointed, we probably will no longer purchase it.

Please note that we have bought the Dark Heather gray color and also the Galapagos blue.  The Dark Heather gray still fit perfect after multiple washes (they have become my go-to shirts now!).

  These shirts may be very old stock or perhaps a slightly different version than I'm used to or very good knockoffs. They have the exact same cut and fit as the Gildan shirts that I usually buy individually or in small packs, and the stitching and everything seems the same, but the material that the shirts are made out of is completely different, a much heavier and rougher feeling cotton. I do not like this material as much. Also these have tags instead of the label printed on the shirt, so there's definitely something different about these than the ones I usually get. I'll keep them because the shirts fit fine and they'll probably soften up over time. If you buy these just don't expect the usual soft cotton.

  I ordered a 2 pack of these shirts in size small, and they fit perfectly. Bright neon pink color. I am a female, 5'4 and 125 pounds. The neck looks small at first upon opening and sleeves look short, but they're true to size as any T-shirt would be. The material was comfortable and seems durable. No scratchiness noted as in other reviews.  I will wash them in cold water, and dry with low heat or hang to dry to prevent any major shrinkage since they are cotton. I also had ordered a pack of mediums to be safe, incase these were too small, but the medium is way too long and a bit baggy for me. For this low price I'll probably just give them to a friend. What a great price for a great product.

  I give this a 5/5 because it fit just as I needed them to. These are not my first Gildan shirts, I have bought some for work and they are still going strong. The fabric is thick, a tad on heavy side, so if you're looking for some shirts to cool down in, these are not it. You should get this shirts if you want them to last and also if you want to feel comfortable if you're on the big body size like I am. Also, these shirts are long enough to cover your big belly if you're on that boat. Be advised, heavy chemical smell, I would recommend washing them because after few minutes I started to get a mild headache. I will update if I have any negative experiences after few washes.<br/><br/>Edit: Lowered rating from 5 to 4 because the shirt shrunk in length after the first wash and dry. It shrunk about 1-2 inches.

  I bought these shirts for my mom and myself. I hate to pay full price for a simple woman's tee ($20) when I can buy TWO for half that price. I am cheap and proud of it.<br/><br/>I grew stealing my brothers clothes and it's a habit that has stuck with me into adulthood. Men's clothes are typically thicker materials, sewn better with reinforced seams, and are longer in the torso area and sleeves. Hallelujah!<br/><br/>I wear these as everyday clothes and sometimes pj tops. If I want to wear layers in cooler weather I can slide my women's tank under one of these babies without any issue.<br/><br/>They wash well, dry well and last forever. Why would I pay more for a lesser product?

Nice shirts but a couple of issues
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  First off, I was looking to replace 6 t shirts. I found these and they were an OK price. Pretty good reviews. The material is a bit stiff, but I have noticed that the more you wash them, the softer they are getting.<br/>Second, the ends curl up something terrible. I have never had t shirts that curl like them. I just dont think there is enough fabric at the ends to make them not curl.<br/><br/>Update: after 6 months, I am disappointed in these. They have done nothing but curl on the sleeves and bottoms. It is irritating. I am going to scrap these and go with some better quality tees<br/><br/>Other then the t shirt curl, these are not bad. I think they may run a bit small, or maybe they just shrank a little

  to myself, because I knew it really wouldn't mean much to me. And it doesn't. But it IS scratchy. The tag says 100% cotton content, from what most would call a 3rd-world country. I have a suggestion --blame your Primo World Companies for bastardizing the products we have grown to expect. These in fact are closer to t-shirt-thin-burlap than what you would call t-shirt-thin-cotton. Yeah, 2/$8.51 should not elicit much expectation. Well, I really did expect to find those mothlike patches of no-fabric here and there. Not to worry, just a natural part of the disintegration process, I say. So don't blame me, Gildan. It's your product. I just calls em like I sees em. Ain't no sense in kicking your dead-ass horse carcass --  you already know how I feel. I'll go get you a shovel.

  Gildan is my go to brand for all things Tee! The size is accurate, the material quality of the heavy duty tee is exceptional and is soft not rough at all. Shirts are roomy without being shapeless and fit long enough for my long torsoed family. They fit well on broad shoulders and big arms as well. I use them for personalizing with iron on vinyl and with printable vinyl.  These shirts take the vinyl with no issues and the family loves the personal touch. They have an excellent variety of colors from standard to very bright and they don't seem to fade easily. There is little shrinkage after washing and drying.  The price point can't be beat for this kind of quality. The customer service is also exceptional and just one more reason to buy these shirts!  Amazon and Gildan make my tshirt crafting life easier and much more affordable!

  I bought two double packs of these T-shirts, one for my husband and one for my son. I got two different sizes and they fit as expected. They are a little roomy but not baggy or oversized. They are thicker than I expected which is a good thing. They're not super special but, for the low price, my husband and son both think they're fine. They did shrink a bit in wash even though I washed them in cold and removed them from the dryer before they were totally dry. The shrinkage wasn't enough to make a difference in the way they fit. Overall, these are simple cotton T-Shirts that are made quite well.

  These shirts came in a timely manner and feel like they're great quality. Unfortunately, one of them had two noticeable stains on the front of the shirt. Even on a navy colored shirt, they were very easy to see. It almost looked like oil spots or something. This was straight out of the packaging.<br/><br/>The return policy for these seems weird and difficult to navigate. At one point, it was going to charge me nearly the entire cost of the product just to have the pleasure of returning them, which is absurd. I would avoid this product and seller.

  Good shirt. Good price. Quality seems very good. There is double stitching on the sleeves, bottom, and neck, and seams. Gives the impression of durability. Great for lounging around the house, or small trips around town. It does feel heavier than other t-shirts like Hanes or Fruit of the Loom, that are meant to be worn inside under the main shirt. I usually buy X-Large for other t-Shirts, but got Large for this shirt after checking out the sizing chart. Fit was good. These t-shirts do not look cheap...even though the price is.

  I bought these after my favorite heavy cotton T-shirts by Russell seem to have been discontinued, because I can't find them for sale anywhere these days. All they sell now is in large part polyester.<br/><br/>I got the black ones and they are 100% cotton according to the label. These T-shirts are not as heavy as I would like, but the weight is still OK. I would not go any lower than 6 oz though.<br/><br/>There is no vanity sizing here, small means small, so there is no need to adjust for the marketing department.<br/><br/>The fabric is not exactly soft, but also not really scratchy. I'm sure sensitive people will not like it. My first association when feeling it on my skin was linen.<br/><br/>Supposedly the tags can be torn off, which I have not tried yet. So far I can deal with them.<br/><br/>All in all it's a decent product and we'll see how long they last. The arguably better ones that I just replaced cost $70 for 10, these are $35 for 10. At that price there's really not much to argue.

  Size 2XL waist and chest are a just little on the loose side for my 40-inch waist and 47-inch chest.  Buts shoulders are very wide with seams that drop down my arms 2+ inches.  And the sleeve holes are a little larger than other t-shirts I have, including some older Gildan Ultra Cotton.  I'd say these would fit well on someone with a 48-50-inch chest, broad shoulders, and big biceps!  If you're between an XL and 2XL, get this shirt in size XL.  I think an XL would fit me perfectly across the shoulders, but might be a little tight across my waist and chest.  What I do like is the heavy cotton material and sleeve length, which is much better than the t-shirts now being sold in stores made of thin, clingy, man-made fabrics with ultra-short sleeves.

  These are the cheap but sturdy t shirts we buy at Michaels for my son to wear while working on his car. Motor oil and grease don't show of course on black t shirts. I ordered from Amazon after not being able to get the size I needed from Michael's. The shipment came in quickly enough. The shirts feel heavy and are well sewn. I don't see any defects. The only con I see is that after washing in cold water with mild detergent, these shirts had a chemical odor. I don't know if it could be the dyeing process or what but the smell is quite strong. It reminds me of ant poison. After washing a second time in warm water and an odor removing liquid, I was able to get a diminished smell. We are going to toss these after my son works on changing his motor oil or work on his engine. I will probably try another order to see if this is just an odd occurance, since I do not see anyone else complaining.

  I’m 6 foot tall and barrel chested with broad shoulders and have always purchased 2X, but I found,  like most  all cotton clothing, repeated  washings and dryer cycles cause shrinkage, so I recommend going up a size or two if you prefer loose fitting apparel. These are well made, but better suited for less humid weather conditions,  given the thickness of the cotton material. I have another brand made of thinner cotton for brutally hot conditions.  I purchased 3X and I am very satisfied. These are very durable and well priced.

  These shirts are a good quality construction, they are not very soft, but they are durable. They are made for men with smaller arms, shoulders and slightly larger waist section, so basically if you are a normal weight for your height or slightly overweight man mostly carrying in the mid section, this should fit you very comfortably.  If you have larger arms or shoulders, or you work out, then you will find the sleeves very tight around the armpit, uncomfortably so.  Likewise, if you have a trim waist or are on the thin side, you will find the mid section of these shirts to be very loose, almost tent like.

  These shirts work well as both undershirts and t-shirts. The material is decently heavy and not see-through, and the fit is not too tight / loose / otherwise unflattering. When worn as an undershirt, they don't feel heavy or suffocating. On top of that, these are inexpensive and available in a number of colors. There is a tag in the back, which is designed to be torn off IIRC, but it hasn't bothered me at all. So far I haven't noticed any shrinkage from laundry.<br/><br/>I have also tried the Gildan DryBlend t-shirts. The material on the DryBlends is some kind of synthetic blend which is lighter. It's also a bit transparent, so more suitable as an undershirt and less as a t-shirt. Overall, I would say that I prefer the Ultra Cottons over the DryBlends for both usages. The quality of both seems to be good though.

  This is a good t-shirt for everyday wear. It is well-made and one should get many years of use from it. It is not s as soft as some brands one can buy, but that leads me to believe that it will last longer. As an outer wear shirt rather than an under Wear shirt. I love the ones I bought In various colors and wear them simply as stand alone t-shirts without an extra shirt over them. For cold days, one can slip on a long-sleeved patterned shirt that matches the color of the t-shirt and achieve a nice layered, comfortable look.

  These Gildan T shirts I wasn't expecting much, I figured for $7.90 for a pair of gray T shirts I would love or hate them, but had to try. These T shirts are perfect weight, same as others I paid much more for. I can get 4 of these T shirts for price other brand I been buying for 1. I am actually shocked they are so good. Time will tell if they shrink up. They are true to size, not oversized or under. So if 3 XL shirts are slightly small on you, I would go for a 4 XL. Looking to buy more and replace my older worn out T shirts.

  These shirts are great quality for 5xl shirts and at 5 bucks each i cant complain too much. Although after washing and drying as directed they shrunk a bit and now fit right above the belt which is too short and my belly hangs out slightly and they are a little snug in the belly. But if you dont dry them in the machine and air dry on hangers you should be ok.

  4 months ago I bought the ""Heavy Cotton"" and it fit fine. Last month I bought the ""Ultra Cotton"", and after a few washings I noticed the length in front (neck down) appeared shorter(above my belt line).  I measured both (after several washings and after wearing for the day), the Heavy cotton was 2 inches longer than the Ultra cotton.  I will be careful in the future to buy the Heavy, and NOT the Ultra.  I have no other complaints... there was a minor difference in the 'thickness' but does not bother me.

  This is the second purchase of these shirts.  I'm a woman 5' 6"" over weight 240's and am long waisted and broad shouldered. I wanted a oversized shirt not tight thru the chest as I go braless.  They are long no chance of riding up when bending  over and loose enough to cover those love handles.  Great as a night shirt also as they cover the hips.  They are just what I wanted to work around the house and in my garden.  Really love them wash great shrank some after washing in warm water and low heat dryer.  The fit I describe is after washing.  Soft 100% cotton which makes great for stain and spills washing out.  The pink shirts I ordered are not the color shone on line.  They are very flourecent pink.

The shirt did shrink a little (shoulders and chest about 1/2"", length about 1"") but this result was not sufficient for a proper fit.  Since I've washed one of them I can't return it. On this purchase, lesson learned, I'll cut my losses. Doubtful they will step up. We'll see.

  Finally found a nice basic tee made with medium-heavy weight cotton that has some body to it, far better than the tee shirts in stores made of super thin, flimsy fabric, that look like they'll fall apart after a couple of washings. These tee are made with good material, good construction, they have a good fit, and they hold their own shape fairly well.<br/><br/>The only con I have is how the sleeves are sewn in at a slight downward angle (compared to my older tee shirts, in which the sleeves are sewn in at more of a right angle to the body of the shirt); this makes the sleeves somewhat restrictive of arm movement as you reach up or out with your arms.<br/><br/>But overall, this is a good tee, and I'll be buying more of them, at least until I find some with a better sleeve design.

Not the Same Gildan as I am Used To...

<span>
  First, I must preface this review with the fact that I have been buying Gildan Ultra Cotton shirts for almost 10 years, and these shirts are nice, but not the same as I have previously purchased. My first impression was that the fabric is not as heavy as my previous shirts, and upon checking where they were made, it states that they were made in Nicaragua. I checked my older shirts and found that they were made in Honduras. I then tried the new shirts on, and found that they did not fit the same as my others, meaning, they were less roomy around the stomach, tighter across the shoulders, and not as long. All this in mind, I can’t give them a 5 star rating since they aren’t comparable to what I have become accustomed to. But, two shirts for 10 bucks are hard to pass up and I will keep them, just not buy these particular ones again.

  Gildan is really good for getting a couple plain t-shirts that are decent. They don't feel paper-thin like a pack of Hanes undershirts; they're actually pretty thick and have a nice quality. They do fit kinda weird. The sleeves are very wide and look loose unless you have Hulk Hogan's pythons. They're a tiny bit longer than shirts of a similar size. I would recommend them. I mean, $8 for 2 decent shirts is hard to beat.

  These shirts seem to be well enough constructed and are probably very comfortable if they fit your build. I originally bought a size up due to reviews about shrinkage. They didn't shrink that much so the XXL didn't fit. Second time around I bought my usual size, XL. This size was comfortable in the shoulders but reached halfway to my knees. In other words, these shirts appear tailored specifically to men with a narrow build. If you're athletic build or muscular, the cut will be either too tight in the chest and shoulders or too long. I'm not sure why Gildan designed them like this, as their sweatshirts fit me perfectly. Hey designers, not all men are 6' tall and 140lbs.

  These are decent all cotton t shirts that for some reason remind me of the way Hanes used to fit.  They are a little loose in the arms, but tighter up in the shoulders so they don't feel quite right.  I am 6' 1"" and about 215 with broad shoulders and this tends to be an issue for me, so I've tried a lot of different T shirts.<br/><br/>At this point I prefer the synthetic cotton blends as they tend to hold their size better after washing.  Being all cotton, these wear like the t's I used to buy 10 years ago, and have the same issues after washing.  I gave these a shot because of the price, and because my current favorite, Next Level, is a little tight in the guns for my liking.  I think I'd still stick to those at this point.<br/><br/>The search for perfection in a t shirt under 10 bucks continues.

  For years I had a tie-dyed tee that my daughter had bought me.  I wore it until it was just worn out.  I liked the shirt itself was the reason for its' longevity.  Looking at a hole worn in the old thing, it occurred to me that perhaps I could find the basic shirt if I looked.  Finally I found them!  Same model sans the wild dye job.  Priced right, too.  I ordered a two pack of them  and Prime had them in my mail box two days later.  Ah...satisfaction!  Actually improved with their neat tear off label...great innovation!<br/>Just what I was looking for.  Money well spent...I'm ordering some more after this trial run.

  I am disappointed in these shirts.  I put one on and immediately took it off.  The fabric felt coarse and the neck was too small.  I am not a weight-lifter and do not have a large neck for my body.  These shirts went right into the Goodwill bin.

  The all cotton shirts (not heathers) shrink significantly after washing/drying.  I ordered a size up after reading reviews on this, but the fit is a little awkward anyway, boxy and the sleeves are disproportionately short.

  One of the shirts arrived a little dirty looking for some reason but I washed them before wearing. They are dark black and didn’t fade or shrink in the wash on both delicate/normal cycles with cold water. I was them often. The fabric is nice and durable, I’m sure they’ll last me awhile.<br/><br/>I am a female but I prefer men’s tshirts. In women’s and unisex shirts I’m a Medium size so I ordered a Small. They fit me pretty snug on the arms (I have big arms), but the rest of the shirt fit okay. I will order a Medium next time.<br/><br/>I would say they are pretty good quality for the price. Would buy again. I suggest ordering your unisex shirt size.

  The shirt was fine quality, it is a heavier cotton like it says. I bought a bunch of shirts to iron on a design for a party, they fit on the smaller side to begin with. We washed a Men’s XL just to see how much it would truly shrink. The picture shows the other shirt in the pack not washed, behind the shirt we washed. Sadly, the material is one that will most likely keep skrinking every wash. Might be okay if you line dry only.

  With just one wash in warm water and then drying in a warm dryer this shirt shrank so much that it was too short, too tight in the chest, and too tight at the arms.

  These t-s are the best heavy- (but not too heavy!) weight all cotton shirts I have ever found, and you cannot beat the price. Nice heft, they are nonetheless soft, hang well and don't cling, yet are classically, perfectly cut. These things launder really well, too. They hold the heft forever; I have one of these t's that is a good 10 years old and it has held the color and body ever since. Perfect when you need an opaque, full coverage, heavier t that breathes well. Genuinely worth it at double + the price.

  I scoured Amazon researching T-Shirts. Apparently a great many famous brands have declined in quality over the years. I ordered Gildan based on the reviews. Just got these this week. The thickness and weight of the fabric, and the way the shirts fit are a cut above many of the other T-Shirts I've collected over the years. We'll see about durability and how they fit and feel after multiple washings, but for right now, they're great.

It was so weird that I thought maybe it was an error but both shirts are cut like that.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give them one star was they seem to be made of pretty heavy cotton for the price.  Of course it doesn't do me any good.

  I actually needed a green shirt for a photography session, and the hue that was needed were some of the selection of this brand. Upon buying the shirt, and used it for the session the quality was average at best. The thin nature of the shirt meant that with repeated washing or wear it would tear.

  I was looking for soft cotton shirts.  I don't like any polyester in my clothing and it's getting harder and harder to find 100% soft cotton tee shirts that can be wore out in public for casual wear.  These seemed perfect.  I always wash the first time and after washing these they became stiffer, wrinkles that won't go away and most importantly they feel ""itchy""  They may be 100% cotton but perhaps there is something in the dye that makes them not cottony soft.

I'm not a small guy, I'm 5'7 &amp; 190 lbs but the way my body is, you wouldn't really guess i was that heavy. So based on certain charts, that height and weight is a large. But most of my shirts are medium and a size 33 waist :/ such an odd body lol. Kudos to the seller. I simply tried on one of the 2 shirts and immediately noticed it was way too large for me. I requested a refund and i wasn't even responsible for sending it back! That was awesome because it made it much easier for me to go back and buy the correct size!

  Headline says it all. If you're looking for a cheap shirt to work in or exercise in or use (like me) to print something on for fun (it was a white elephant gift), then this is your shirt. It's not soft. It's moderately thick and heavy. The crew neck is a little too high for my taste. It served its purpose, but it's not a shirt I'd ever recommend for wearing. It's just a cheap shirt. 3/5 stars isn't because it's bad, just because it's quite average. It doesn't try to sell itself for anything more than it is, or anything less.

  I ordered this 2 pack for my Etsy business. I had just pressed the vinyl image on it and was just about to fold it and package it to get it shipped to my customer when I noticed there was a rip in the sleeve. Luckily it comes in a 2 pack so I had a backup but, having to redo the shirt for my customer was pretty frustrating. I'll order again if I get in a jam but I'll make sure to do a quality control check first. I don't think there is anyone to blame just my luck.

  Gildan’s mens ultra cotton t-shirts have a thicker feel than most tees, and the 2-pak is a great value. These have been washed &amp; dried several times with no shrinking or fading, and the side seams don’t twist or stretch out. Perfect for college age guy who lives in tees.

  I like this shirts, they're 100% cotton, 6 oz.<br/>They're a little coarse compared to other cotton shirts, definitely coarser than any combed or brushed cotton, however this also means the fabric will resist more machine wahsing and abuse. The shrink and stretch process will make it your favorite shirt after some use.

  I'm a pretty thick on the waist right now, so it's more tight for me around the midsection as a result. This shirt seems to fit better on fit people. If you're looking for it to be loose on the midsection, consider going up a size.<br/><br/>I've washed this shirt 2-3 times and it seems to be keeping its shape and size, so that's nice. It's a cheap shirt though, so if it does start to shrink after 7-10 washes, it's not a big deal to buy a new one.

  Rough and scratchy...even after numerous washings  (with fabric softener). The weight is just a little heavier than I was looking for, but that could be a plus to others. I was looking to replace some worn out (and apparently discontinued) Gold Toe shirts that I put on every day after work. They are fairly lightweight and super soft - and are the shirts I lounge in, sleep in, and work around the house in. I have some Gildan Dry-Blend shirts that I like ok, but wanted a higher cotton ratio in hopes that these would be softer next to the skin. No such luck. They’re probably scratchier than the Dry-Blend. Definitely heavier. The search continues...

  I bought these primarily to wear under a long sleeved shirt, so I'm not concerned with the wrinkle factor or the looks.  My build usually puts me between a Medium and Large, so I usually purchase shirts sized Large. To me these definitely fit like a large.  My only comment is that they are a little thicker/heavier/stiffer(?) than most t-shirts I've previously purchased, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but surprising.

  These T-shirts are OK for knockin' around the house, but the cotton isn't all that soft and they come out of the dryer really wrinkled. The biggest thing they have going for them is price, at about four and a half bucks per shirt. Personally, I prefer Amazon Essentials T-shirts, which are softer, come out of the dryer far less wrinkled, and cost just a little more at about six bucks a shirt.

  Worth it to spend a little extra money and get a better, higher quality brand from a reputable seller. At first the shirt seems fine, just really thin. After a few cycles through a washer/dryer the quality becomes unbelievably terrible. The shirts are cheaply manufactured from cheap materials.

  I was looking to replace some red heathered Mossimo Athletic Fit T-Shirts that I really liked, which apparently they no longer make. Compared to those, the sleeves on these just don't fit nicely; the ends are to wide and they flop around a bit instead of following the curve of the arm. The color is much brighter than the picture which looks to me almost maroon. I got the Antique Cherry Red, and I guess the red does indeed look like a bright artificial cherry red lipstick, with black specs. The threading is in a lighter shade of red, and the overall effect is just blech. Unlike the picture, this also has a white tag on the inside back of the collar, which the Mossimo shirts don't (they have a tagless label). I always have to remove such tags, which sometimes damages the shirt. I ended up returning the 2-pack.

  Good for a basic T. My son is 6’ and thin so he bounces between M and L depending on brand.  Since we are purchasing as an undershirt I went with the medium and it seems to run on the smaller side of a medium.  I don’t know that there would be issues if he wasn’t as tall. He also prefers softer style for an undershirt. Amazon immediately issued refund. Wasn’t for us but no real complaints.

  Fits a little looser at the chest than most, which I usually like because im a bigger guy, however I think most of the issue is I actually ordered a size up from where I should be. I had lots of issues finding something that was actually my size when it said my size. Gildan did a solid job.  The length is at about the top of my pockets maybe slightly lower which means I can raise my arms without turning it into a cutoff. Overall very impressed.

  The venerable Gildan Ultra Cotton t-shirts have changed.  They now significantly shrink after the first washing, and the material is not as thick as they used to be.  A big disappointment after so many years of wearing them.  Buy them a full size larger, wash them, and they'll be a little larger than what you expected out of the ""correct"" size.

  Like a lot of other manufacturers, Gildan has started designing their shirts to be tight / athletic shaped in the chest and shoulders. This is a terrible idea and doesn't work. It just makes it look like I'm trying to wear a muscle shirt, and gives a weird, sharp, tight, angular shape to my shoulders and traps. They should ditch this terrible idea and just go back to having normally shaped, neutral-fitting shirts.

Which is what I normally do when buying shirts. I would recommend the same. I am 5' 10"", 160lbs and I bought a size L. After a wash in some cold water and some drying, the shirt fits me perfect for how I like my shirts to be. The color is just fine as well. I washed it a couple of times now and the black has not faded one bit. Great shirts!

Into the trash they went; I'd feel worse about it all if the price was any higher. As it is, lesson learned.

  I wanted  it to  fit loosely so I ordered the next size up.  I think that I probably should have ordered my regular size.  Once I washed and dried it, it fit better and still quite loose so I'm happy with my choice.  I wish the fabric was a little softer and for summer wear, a little lighter.  In cooler weather, this shirt will be perfect.  It seems well-made and likely to last a long time.  Great for the low price.  Before washing, I soaked in cold water - several times as lots of dye ran out.  Didn't affect the shirt, though.  It's still as deeply colored as before washing it.

  Bought these shirts because I own a number of the same brand, style, fabric, etc. But the neck hole (what do you call that on  a t-shirt with no collar?) is about 20% smaller than the shirts I have. Measured that much smaller. Not a function of old shirts sagging, stretching or simply aging. The circumference of the neck hole is just that much smaller. Makes the shirt uncomfortable &amp; looks funny. My wife noticed it instantly as soon as I put the shirt on. So, I'm not a happy customer.

  This is not premium cotton as stated in the description. There’s nothing soft or premium about it which I should have known from the price tag.  In fact, if anything, I would characterize the fabric as hard or rough.  You get what you pay for and I was away from home and in a real bind. Only reason I ordered. Will not be ordering again.

  Very disappointed in these t-shirts. Bought to wear as pajama tops but the fabric is so rough, scratchy, and stiff that they'll have to be used as work shirts only. I even considered cutting them up to use as rags, the fabric is that unpleasant. I've had some Gildan shirts over the years that I've loved for their comfort and durability, but these are NOT that. I'd send them back if it didn't seem like more hassle than it's worth. Just gonna eat the $10 this time.

  Shirt fits great. Material is not to thick or thin. perfect for an undershirt or by it self. One of the shirts had a black piece of fabrick that was stiched into where the colar fold is at with no way to remove easily but cut a hole on the inside of the colar. Just a manufacturing flaw. normaly would be a 5 star but you wouldnt read it then. Gildean makes great shirts that last.

  Shirts are not of the same quality as a Gildan Ultra Cotton I already own. These are of a lighter material (not as thick). The tags are not the same as my original. These appear to be cheaply screened. Maybe knock-offs? Will still keep them. For $5 each, they're still nice enough to wear. I just don't know how well they'll hold up and if the color (black) will fade.

  Few items to note here. First the cost of these shirts are super cheap so I expected them to not be the greatest quality or to last a super long time either. Figured I would buy these for an upcoming vacation and if they lasted after that, it would be a bonus. Two of the four shirts were not even stitched at the sleeve and one had some threads that if pulled would pull apart the collar stitches. There is a difference being of cheaper quality and not even assembling your product properly to sell. With only one good shirt in the bunch, the deal for 15.00 for four shirts really is 15 for one wearable shirt. Beware as you will get what you pay for here.

  So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting  or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.

<span>
  I'm used to Hanes shirts, and these are very comparable in quality and fit. The large fits my 6'1"" frame correctly.<br/><br/>My minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.<br/><br/>For the price, these are a fantastic buy.

  You are looking at these because you want some white t-shirts but want the cheapest set you can find. These shirts are ""good enough"" for an undershirtz provided that you don't care if they shrink after one wash. If you just wear them under your work shirt and take them off when you get home, these are perfect. If you want to wear these as a shirt by itself, I'm not so sure this is the best option. Maybe I just shouldn't have put this in the dryer but then again other shirts I've done this with haven't shrunk so much.

  ""Men's Crew T-Shirt"" with 6"" of blouse hanging like a fool, and an absurd toilet bowl seat of a collar -- purposely disguised (downplayed) in the product photos. These might be okay--if you're cool as a ghost pepper n need to shove a pound of cotton in your trousers for that oh so glorious drill sergeant tuck, or you're going to a Halloween party as 1999 Slim Shady--as an undershirt, but unless you're 6'5""+ or very overweight (to compensate for all that material down yonder) yet somehow still have a 42""-44"" chest, then you're going to look completely ridiculous in this clown shirt.<br/><br/>Considering the price point, this is precisely the QC I should've expected from this sorry product -- 'proudly' shelved alongside MainStays goods at WallyWorld. Geez Gildan: I'm done with your company. These are being sent back.<br/><br/>Why should anyone buy these? I guess if you're the type of guy who takes your girl to Arby's for the holidays, then these would make for perfect pajamas to go on your loved one and along with your frugal affairs -- especially when she needs to blast Taco Bell out at 4am the morning after her BDay and there's no time to drop trou.<br/><br/>TL;DR Clown shirt w/ toilet seat for collar.

  Good price for a 6pack of undershirts. Im 6'3, on the lean side, with a basketball in front.<br/>A top notch high end Tshirt, I can get by with a true American large.<br/>I ordered an XL on these, expecting a good bit of shrink, like I do other bulk pack T's.<br/>The XL fits me absolutely perfect out of pack. Not skin tight, but not a moo moo either.<br/>Length out of pack is to my fingertips, arms held down,  like a good sport coat length.<br/>Hands up, length covers my belt buckle out of pack.<br/>Cheap XL = high end L.<br/>After one wash/dry, these drew up about 2 inches, shrank about 1/2-1"" over all girth.<br/>The fit actually got better, neck is great, but the length is kinda pushing it for moving around, and bending over etc.<br/>It will come un tucked under my work shirt. But so does every other cheap bulk pack non-tall shirt.<br/>I really probably should've went with a tall size, but these will do fine for an undershirt.<br/>Nice summer weight.

Clearly the QC department marked that as a defective shirt, but it was still included in the package even though it was marked as defective.<br/>A couple weeks ago I had bought a pack of the same Gildan shirts at Target and one of the shirts had a 1"" diameter hole in it, so apparently this is an ongoing problem with quality control.

  Few items to note here. First the cost of these shirts are super cheap so I expected them to not be the greatest quality or to last a super long time either. Figured I would buy these for an upcoming vacation and if they lasted after that, it would be a bonus. Two of the four shirts were not even stitched at the sleeve and one had some threads that if pulled would pull apart the collar stitches. There is a difference being of cheaper quality and not even assembling your product properly to sell. With only one good shirt in the bunch, the deal for 15.00 for four shirts really is 15 for one wearable shirt. Beware as you will get what you pay for here.

<span>
  So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting  or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.

Comparable to Hanes

<span>
  I'm used to Hanes shirts, and these are very comparable in quality and fit. The large fits my 6'1"" frame correctly.<br/><br/>My minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.<br/><br/>For the price, these are a fantastic buy.

  You are looking at these because you want some white t-shirts but want the cheapest set you can find. These shirts are ""good enough"" for an undershirtz provided that you don't care if they shrink after one wash. If you just wear them under your work shirt and take them off when you get home, these are perfect. If you want to wear these as a shirt by itself, I'm not so sure this is the best option. Maybe I just shouldn't have put this in the dryer but then again other shirts I've done this with haven't shrunk so much.

These might be okay--if you're cool as a ghost pepper n need to shove a pound of cotton in your trousers for that oh so glorious drill sergeant tuck, or you're going to a Halloween party as 1999 Slim Shady--as an undershirt, but unless you're 6'5""+ or very overweight (to compensate for all that material down yonder) yet somehow still have a 42""-44"" chest, then you're going to look completely ridiculous in this clown shirt.<br/><br/>Considering the price point, this is precisely the QC I should've expected from this sorry product -- 'proudly' shelved alongside MainStays goods at WallyWorld. Geez Gildan: I'm done with your company. These are being sent back.<br/><br/>Why should anyone buy these? I guess if you're the type of guy who takes your girl to Arby's for the holidays, then these would make for perfect pajamas to go on your loved one and along with your frugal affairs -- especially when she needs to blast Taco Bell out at 4am the morning after her BDay and there's no time to drop trou.<br/><br/>TL;DR Clown shirt w/ toilet seat for collar.

GREAT VALUE! Long time Hanes buyer..not anymore, these washed & held up much better!
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  I usually purchase Hanes for my husband, but he goes through white shirts like water since  he manages to get stains everywhere (I believe he thinks they 2nd as a napkin &amp; im the miracle stain remover). So using bleach &amp; soaking in stain removers all white tee’s start to wear down, get tiny holes, and the collar starts fraying. Figured I’d give these a shot for the price and we both love them! I’ve washed many many times and so far so good. Yes, they do shrink a little after the first wash but I expected that. Much better quality than I was expecting &amp; a great value. . Remember this is an undershirt. They’re supposed to be a bit thinner. If you’re looking for a thicker &amp; longer white shirt Kirkland’s pack of white t’s are super thick, durable &amp; longer in length which is great for wearing alone but my husband found them to be too thick for himself in the summer or underneath his work shirts. If you’re looking for an undershirt this pack of Gildan’s are PERFECT! I’ve purchased these a few times now and prefer them over Hanes for the price. They’ve held up much better after being washed with bleach many many times compared to others I’ve washed the same. I don’t mind throwing a few out that I can’t remove the stains from. You can’t expect a luxurious cotton shirt at this price but you can buy 1 Higher end white t for a little more than the entire pack of 6 here, if you have higher expections for white undershirts at this price! Highly recommend for undershirts or those who go through white shirts like we do. Size up if you’re tall or need extra room, they shrink a little after the first wash/dry but so did the Hanes I always used to buy!

  Genius design. It has two short sleeves that partially cover your arms, and a large hole for your head to poke through so the shirt doesn't obscure your view. If you put your arms through the head hole or your head through the arm holes, it doesn't work as well, but when worn as intended it works as advertised. It's great for covering my torso in warmer weather and in a pinch it can be folded and tied to look like a ninja mask.<br/><br/>They're t-shirts, folks. That's all.

They had a very funky odor, so I immediately threw them in the washer, and since the colors were dark, washed them in cold water. Once the cycle finished, I pulled one out and thought, ""Wait, what is this?"" The shirt had SHRUNK half its original size! I held it up and it barely touched my waist! The sleeves were tight on me, so I knew they'd never fit my Hubby.<br/>They won't fit me or even our 10-year-old son! I am so disappointed, and now have nothing to surprise Hubby for Easter.

  I was looking for a t-shirt to replace the brand I have used for years that seems to have slipped in quality over time. I wear these shirts as an outer covering not an undershirt and I prefer them to be somewhat baggy and not clingy. I have worked out for years and even at 64 have some muscle still and prefer not to have shirts clinging to my arms and chest, but not be overly bagging so my neck is floating in a huge neck hole. These shirts appear to be my new go to and I have already ordered more.<br/><br/>I purchased XXL even though I am more just XL to allow for some shrinking to get the fit I want. I washed them in warm water with other whites and dried them under high heat to shrink them up just a bit and now they are about perfect. The neck does feel a little backward when I first put one on, but I just stretch is slightly and all is well.<br/><br/>They are the perfect weight fabric for my liking. Not see through by any means but not heavy so they feel comfy on those hot muggy days in Michigan. They might be just a tad long when worn outside, but I am a tucker for the most part anyway so not a big deal to me. They are not wrinkle free so I normally get them right out of the dryer, give them a shake and fold them for storage. So there are a few wrinkles when I first put one on, but after a bit they smooth out to a decent level - again for my tastes.<br/><br/>It kind of depends on what you are looking for when it comes to t-shirts, so hopefully my review will allow others, who are looking for a similar fit, to make a purchasing decision.

PS: have a high efficency front-loading washer, where you can not use liquid bleach, or the rubber seals will begin to prematurely fail.  I find “Borax” or “Arm&amp;Hammer Baking Powder Laundry Booster” works great as a substitute.  To like to use the extra rinse cycle when using these harsher chemicals.

  I've been buying Gildan shirts for years, yes sometimes sketchy but this time is GARBAGE.<br/>I opened my bag up and started to put the new white t shirts in the washer... omg, these are super light and thin. So being an engineer I got out my high accuracy scale.  Gildan white shirt from 2 years ago weighs 7.96oz but the new Gildan weighs only 5.20oz and sadly that is a 35% reduction in materials i.e cotton. I will be sending these right back to where they came from.  BTW - I went ahead and weighed the Costco Kirkland brand and they weighed a solid 8oz.

  I am a female but I wear men’s undershirts (or any men’s clothing I like, doesn’t matter to me). I bought these shirts Sz small in color black to wear under my law enforcement uniform and they are great. I wash them several times and also put them in the dryer, because I don’t care (their purpose is undershirt anyways). Yes they shrunk a little bit but it worked in  my favor, as I mentioned before I am a female, and these are men’s so they were a little big on a Sz small so whatever if they shrunk. It wasn’t so bad anyways. The material is soft enough, if you have to wear a law enforcement uniform for 12 hours a day, for the ones who knows what I mean, ANYTHING ELSE IS SOFT. I also wear them for my PT training. I don’t know about other people, but with the type of job I have and at my age I really don’t look so much for fashion, looks etc, but comfort. Is what matters to me the most. Plus you can’t  beat the price for 6 T-shirts. I’m am getting another set. Oh, and they’re also tag-less ( I can’t stand tags). Get them if you are looking for something comfortable and durable. If you are in the fashion “I am going to show off my new T-shirts” side, perhaps these ones are not for you. Although you can wear them out if you want. Nothing wrong with that.<br/>For the females who are interested on getting these: I am 5’7”, bra Sz 36C, 126lbs, 47 years old and wear a Sz. Small in mens.

Best t-shirt purchase I've made in 6 years
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  TL:DR - buy a pack of these shirts, good quality, great value<br/><br/>I am pleasantly surprised by the fit of these shirts. They are thicker/heavier weight fabric than I expected.  It feels like a substantial undershirt, even after a couple of washes.  The fabric is comfortably woven and properly soft.<br/><br/>I used to be a big fan of Stafford brand heavy weight t's for their fabric quality and fit.  I am just shy of 6' even and wear a 40 long or 42 regular jacket depending on actual cut. (Seriously, though? How can there be so much variation when the size is literally in measured lengths rather than S, M, L, etc.?). But lately, with J.C.Penney declines, I've been trying other brands. Hanes &amp; Fruit of the Loom are readily available, but the shirts are shorter and much thinner/lighter weight fabric.<br/><br/>These shirts are long - well below my belt, not too long, matching the length of most of my oxford/button down shirts and better quality polos.  I don't feel like they'll come out of my waistband and bunch in an unsightly lump under my tucked in shirt.  The sleeves are a good length - long enough they don't wad up in my armpits by midday and short enough to not stick out when worn under another short-sleeved shirt.<br/><br/>I was a little skeptical about these because of the excellent price point.  I have had graphic t's (from local shops) that were on Gildan product, and been pleased with the quality.  But I thought these might be something different.  My doubts have been assuaged.  The neck and hem are holding up well after a couple of wearings.  The neck holds up remarkably well at the end of the day, especially when compared to other brands I have been wearing recently.<br/><br/>Finally, overall I think the fit is excellent, probably what an ""L"" should have been all along.  I'm right on the line between M &amp; L sizing and so getting a good fit is sometimes tricky.  Almost always the M is too small, short, &amp; tight in chest and often an L in the same brand/style just feels too big.  Over the past few years, L's have been getting smaller (no, not because I'm getting bigger) especially in body length.  But these shirts are just right. for me.  (If I lose 15 lbs, they might be a little loose in the waist, so if you're the athletic type keep that in mind.)<br/><br/>One thought on price - do the math, and I don't think you'll find many offers to compete. I get these for like two-sixty each and that wasn't even a ""deal"" price.  That makes these not only a good shirt, but a good value.

Not Exactly Egyptian Cotton, but For the Price, No Complaints!
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">

  4-Star only because they are not made of Egyptian cotton, or the closest in quality, Pema cotton. Of course, Egyptian cotton would have quadruple the price. But would have also given them 5-Star rating.<br/><br/>The feel is definitely smooth first time use, but once washed, that will change. That is the difference between Egyptian cotton and the rest of the world's cotton. I have purchased T-shirts while on a trip to Egypt. I have had them for 6 years now, and they are still as soft as the day I bought them from STIA in a Cairo suburban mall. They were ridiculously cheap, and will probably last another ten years. Had I known, I would have purchased the entire stock at the time.<br/><br/>These shirts are perfect fit. Made in Honduras, one will not expect them to last more than a year, but they are inexpensive and replacing them should not bankrupt me. I bought two dozen this time just because Amazon had them on sale.

  First off I want to say that the first pack I ordered are absolutely amazing! The gray and black pack is a great thick but thin and soft but stretchy material, 5 stars for sure. I ordered the second pack of these shirts because my husband loved the first pack (Gray and Black). The second pack I bought, the pack with the blue, red, and gray shirts are way worse quality. The first 3 shirts that I opened out of this pack were fine...... although a slightly different material than the other colored pack I bought (the material of the other pack was awesome), they still seemed to be decentish quality. The last two shirts that came in the pack look like the machine that sewed them screwed up, there is stitching out of place everywhere with long strands hanging off and stiching crossing from the front to back. I wouldn't purchase the specific pack I got this time again.

  Okay let me start by saying the tshirts feel nice and fit the body well. My biggest complaint is the sleeves. They are missing about 2 inches in length. Looks ridiculous so now they are for bed. I say if your looking for a casual tshirt to wear with jeans or chinos... do not buy these shirts. Save your money or spend a little more and buy good shirts such as Calvin Klein or Tommy. But you can’t compare this brand to those so again...if these are for leisure around the house or bed then they may be for you. In my opinion not for jeans and tshirt day. Again this only my opinion and these may be a great fit/look for some, but not for me!

  All shows in comparison. When I bought Banana Republic soft tee (yes, it is $20), I realized that I was wasting money on Guildan t-shirts. Day and night!  Now I cannot even put on Guildan t-shirts and will be disposing of them, since I see no use for the product. After using Banana Republic for few days, Guildan t-shirts seem harsh and deformed, not soft on skin, heavy, and very uncomfortable comparable to Banana Republic soft tees. The difference is obviously in much much quality of fabric and I guess we need to pay more for higher quality. The feel is more like Underarmour, another good option, but also more expensive. I wish Amazon focused more on quality vendors, reviews often don't tell much since they are often produced by people who did not have a chance to try high good quality products. It's all about price.

Im quite happy so far. Im an XXL in shirts but I ordered these XL b/c I wanted the shirts to show as much as possible at the neck and being a little tight up there does the trick.  They do not feel tight otherwise.  However they are NOT the type of cotton t-shirts to wear as your main outside shirts.  They are thin, and to make them last I'll be washing in cold only.  I did NOT have any that were fraid or with holes or strings showing.  For the price, I definitely recommend and will be ordering again.

  They almost made a good T-shirt. Anyone that wears undershirts knows you can't review them until you've washed and dried them to determine what size undershirt you end up with. Shrinkage is about average for these undershirts, but the sleeves are cut too short to properly function as an undershirt should.  After washing these shirts in hot water and fully drying them, the sleeves just don't feel right and defeat the whole purpose of wearing an undershirt since your armpits aren't fully covered.  You'd think an undershirt manufacturer would know that sleeve length is critical and would then take measures to get that measurement correct.  The overall length of the undershirt is good in that it's a little longer than a non-undershirt T-shirt, which means it's more likely to remain tucked in as you move around.  If your shoulder width is on the narrow side, then these shirts may fit you well.  If your shoulder width is average or above, then order a size up to account for shrinkage.  Otherwise, I can't recommend these shirts due to the sleeves being too short.  Also, the shirt material itself has a stiffer, more canvas-like feel than undershirts from other brands. This stiffness decreases after washing and drying, but still remains.

  I bought these shirts because I hate how shirts get short after you wash them. When I first got these shirts they fit amazingly. The neck was snug which is what I also like. The arms were good and lastly and most importantly, the length was great. If the shirt stayed that way after washing, I would be done looking for shirts and would have just stuck to this brand forever. However, after washing it went out of wack like most shirts do and became a shirt I did not like. I have a few shirts that stood the test of time and no matter how much I wash it, it remains the same and I am always trying to hunt for shirts that can live up to my, what seems to be impossible standards. I guess its back to the drawing board.<br/><br/>If all that stuff mentioned above doesn't bother you then these shirts are pretty good quality and I would recommend them but only if you don't care that they will shrink after washing. The colors were nice and the shirt is comfortable to wear.<br/><br/>Hope this review helps you out. Thanks for reading!

After first wash it was skin tight.  Then I tried XL and it was like 2-4 inch bigger all sides. After first wash it fits perfectly 😃.

  Normally I believe that you get what you paid for, but in this case I got 6 T-shirts for only $10 so I wasn’t expecting much. I wear t-shirts as undershirts and for working in the yard so I am not looking for something pretty. At 6/3” and 185 lbs, I normally wear a large tall, but when no tall option is offered an extra large usually works if it shrinks a little when washed. That is what happened with these and they fit perfectly now. I was afraid these t-shirts would be “seconds” or defective in some way at that price, about $1.70 apiece, but so far have found no flaws and they are not thin or cheap looking as some reviews claimed. I am usually skeptical of great reviews on Amazon and rarely give 5 stars to any product, but for the price, these are great.

  Bought these a couple of times now and they're becoming my favorite t-shirts in my wardrobe. I usually buy whatever is cheapest or on sale do I have a mix of Hanes fruit of the loom and other brands. Lately I've noticed that most brands are starting to use less cotton and more polyester. That's great if you want a shirt that washes and wears well but the pure cotton shirts are a lot more comfortable. These are 100% cotton and because of that they do shrink a bit. I buy my size and purposely shrink them in the wash because I like a snug form fitting undershirt. That's the way we wore them when I was in the service and I like a neat tight collar. These are great for that. If you like a looser shirt I recommend buying a size larger and shrink them. They will only shrink once and after that you have a great looking comfortable t-shirt. These look and feel better than the rest of the brands I have and notice when a fresh load of laundry is finished these are the first tshirts I grab out of the closet. I also think the elastic in the collar last longer on these shirts and the collars themselves are better and more comfortable that other shirts.

  When I think ""GildIan"" I always think of the heavyweight with the tight collar.  So nice!  I should have known with the price being so low that these were a ""lesser"" t shirt.  Indeed they are!  They are light weight to begin with,  and they shrink a fair amount when washed and dried.  I guess if you are using them as a true ""under"" shirt they would be fine. (worn under a regular shirt or sweater or other garment).  But as a stand alone casual t shirt they don't fit the bill.  Fortunately Amazon has a good return policy and I am able to return them.  My suggestion is if you want heavyweight t shirts either include the word ""heavyweight"" in your search or the actual weight such as (6 oz).  That way you will be spared the confusion.

  I purchased these to replace some now impossible-to-find Fruit of the Loom stay-tucked shirts that I had worn out.  These are decent shirts, but they don't measure up to the ones I replaced.  The shirts are of average length, sitting at about 5"" below the belt.  The shirts stretch horizontally, but not vertically.  While this makes for a comfortable fit, they do not want to stay tucked when you bend over or squat.<br/><br/>The material seems slightly thinner than Hanes or FotL, and slightly less soft.  It's still good enough in both regards, just not great.  The sleeves bunch up at the end after being washed and dried.  They stretch back out again just fine, but this will cause some wrinkles around the sleeve when they are folded.  Not a big deal for an undershirt, but still a minor nuisance.  The collar and waist do not bunch up for some reason.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a so-so shirt.  Not great, not terrible.

Great deal for an every day soft T or undershirt

  My husband goes through shirts left and right. Mainly because he works in every shirt I buy him regardless of how many times I tell him that are not for work. He's a mechanic and the uniforms they wear are scratchy so he always wears undershirts. These are great especially in summer since they aren't as thick as some t shirts. He likes to wear them as every day t shirts to and not just layered. He is typically a large but we always order a size up because after a few washes and dries they shrink a little and he likes to keep the legnth on them. As reference he likes his clothes loose but not baggy. Larges fit but he prefers Xl and they fit as expected either way. I will be buying these again.

  The T shirts seem to be of comparable quality to the Hanes shirt I usually get. I haven't washed them yet to see how much they'll shrink. I'm sure they'll shrink some because they are cotton.

  I would NOT recommend buying this BRAND of crew t-shirts for three reasons. First, the cotton material is quite thin. It has a ""cheap"" low-quality texture or feel. Second, the shirts shrank and feels too tight now. Third, the sleeves were shorter than other brands. I thought I was going to get good quality t-shirts for the price, but that was not the case. I think $.50 a t-shirt (garage or rummage sale pricing) would be the correct price for these t-shirts. Don't waste your money; spend more for quality t-shirts from other brands.

Perfect black shirt for police uniform

  I have had these shirts for 3 months, and I primarily wear them under my police uniform. I have the black, crew neck, size large. They are perfect. The neck line is snug without being too tight, and it doesn't stretch out throughout my shift like other brands have (Hanes and FOTL). The shirt has a soft feel and is very comfortable, to the point that I often times wear it when I'm not in uniform. The sleeve length is proportionate to the size of the shirt and I have no issues with the t-shirts sleeves being too long to wear under a short sleeve uniform shirt. They have stood up to frequent trips through the laundry without losing their quality. As someone who is particular with t-shirt style and fit, I can say I highly recommend these, and the price can't be beat.

The second said medium, but when i pulled out the shirts they were so much bigger than the other ones.  I checked the bag and realized the sticker looked as if it had been moved because the top right corner had creases in it and was unaligned.  Pulled up the sticker and the second bag shows the size large.<br/><br/>Having kids over to tie-dye.  Wanted to make shirts a bit big because with my boys, they would outgrow a shirt that they really liked very quickly.  But an adult large is way too big.

  It shrunk after one wash in the cold with similar colors. Did not put in dryer, I had air dried on the clothing line. Weirdly they didn’t all shrink in the same way. The grey ones shrunk in width and length while the blue and red just shrunk in width. Just go a size up. I’m in the process of losing weight so it’ll be fine once I lose the weight but right now the shirt definitely shows the love handles and moobs. I should mention I tried on the grey ones when they arrived but before washing once. They were a little loose which was perfect since it hid the love handles and moobs.

  5'8"" 160 lbs athletic build, wide shoulders and the M fits perfectly. These are so amazing and especially at this price point! I LOVE these shirts. I workout in them and they're so comfortable. Not super thin, not super thick, good quality workmanship so it's perfect for workouts. Soft and doesn't restrict movements. Can't speak to moisture wicking because I wear a beater underneath and don't sweat that much, but it's not like Nike dry fit material. Only washed once and air dried, I wouldn't put them in the dryer, they MAY shrink a little (consider buying 1 size up if you want to dry). I have wide shoulders and longer torso, both length and width are great. I even got compliments wearing them as casual shirts with jeans. I'll probably buy more later. Def recommending.

  The good news:<br/>- Great quality, feels solid<br/>- Soft, with a nice cut for a T-Shirt<br/>- Priced right for a 5 pack<br/>The Bad news:<br/>- Will definitely shrink one full size<br/><br/>Got the Large for my husband (5'10, 190lbs) and they fit perfect, until we washed them. Then they are too snug to wear on their own and will have to be undershirts only. Liked the quality, colors, and price so much that we came back and ordered XL. Those shrunk one full size down to a Large and they are absolutely perfect. We generally wash on Regular or Perm Press with cold water and then dry on Medium heat - just be aware that they will absolutely shrink if they go in the dryer. I would recommend buying ONE FULL SIZE above what you normally wear and you'll be happy after the first wash.

T-Shirts run tight--allow for shrinkage after washing of at least two inches
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  I should of learned my lesson about Gildan--being that I've purchased these t-shirts in the past, from Amazon. They are of a very thin weave. The sleeves are too short. If your a 46 chest--such as me--don't order the ""XL""  order the ""XXL.""  As it stands, the ""XL"" are already tight at my shoulders--without being washed. This lets me know that after being laundered, they will shrink about two inches and will have become a ""torture chamber,"" and too tight. The other negative feature is: There is no breast pocket.  After many washes, being there is no attached label, you will also forget what size they are--due to the printing fading away. This will prevent you from telling, which is the front of the neck--which is lower than the back! They wear well, but being 'flimsy,' I don't recommend as 'outerwear,' such as the much bulkier weave of Hanes--but worn as an 'undershirt.'<br/>Macforlife<br/>Prime Member

  I saw a good deal on a 5-pack of these shirts so I went ahead and pulled the trigger. I prefer men's cut shirts because they normally cover everything I like covered and was hoping these would still do that for me although I couldn't try them beforehand.. I've worn two of the shirts so far and they are excellent quality. They don't feel scratchy at all straight out of the pack. They do definitely cover what I need them to and they are in a color scheme I prefer to wear (dark colors). They would have fit perfectly had I not gained some extra weight during this quarantine period, but aside from that these shirts meet all expectations.

It's not heavy fabric, but I prefer a medium-weight fabric, so this is great for me.<br/><br/>The shirt is well made.

These Gildan T-shirts are PERFECT for this. I’ve also purchased some for my work as well and had a friend engrave them for me with our company logo. I work outside as well and they are much cooler than our work shirts. I will be purchasing several more of these for both of us. We have washed these several times and they are holding up perfect.

  Love these shirts! Use Gildan all the time to tie dye. I got 12 for $15.50 so I just ordered another 12 just in time cuz they changed price. These shirts are durable and hold up thru the dying process and many washes. I have over 30 tie dye shirts and these work the best for me.  The price was amazing but even $2 a shirt which is what I usually pay is a good price. Hopefully the fulfillment center this next batch comes from will be as good as the first cuz sometimes they don't take good care with items in the warehouse and they come damaged or not packaged right which definetly affects how you feel about the product. All in all, you get what you pay for and would definetly recommend  these shirts.

<span>
  These Gildan t-shirts are a good basic layering shirt for under an oxford or a sweater. The fit is spot on and matches my higher priced Calvin Klein undershirts (I'm 6'0"" 185 pounds and large is just right). The quality is not quite as good as my CKs -- the fabric is not quite as soft and construction looks cheaper, but for the price they serve their purpose. Also, after one wash there is a bit of shrinkage in the sleeve length and overall length, and there was a minor amount of pilling to the fabric. The length after wash is about the same as the CK and I think they would stay tucked to a pair of chinos just fine.  Overall, a good undershirt that meets the need for a fraction of higher priced alternatives.

There are holes where the stitching has simply come undone.  I don't see how these shirts will last a month of wear.  The shirts are made of a really think fabric as well, so keep that in mind.

  I've bought the multi-color 5-pack of T-shirts twice, about a year apart.

The last batch, however... the material is not like any T-shirt I've ever seen. It feels stiff and coarse, even after washing, not soft like you expect cotton jersey to be. The stitching and seams are scratchy -- not something I want against my skin. Just hoping they will soften up with more washing. It's a shame, because Gildan products used to be great -- now the only thing that seems consistent is the declining quality. Disappointing.

  Decent quality shirts. I wear a large, but after the first wash it shrank significantly. Almost to a medium. It's in between sizes now. A bit tighter in the torso which i don't mind, but the significant size reduction was in the length and under the armpits. Still wearable, but I like my t shirts to not expose my backside when I bend down. There are ways to mitigate that though; after the first wash just stretch it out and hang dry.

  I always wash my clothes in cold water and dry with very low heat to minimize any shrinkage.  These shirts shrank so bad i can't even tuck them into my pants!  I have other t-shirts made by Gildan that do not shrink but I would stay away from these unless you wash in cold water and air dry your t-shirts!  I realize these are cheap but i have similar cheap Hanes t-shirts that barely shrink after washing and drying.

  I have super sensitive skin, and these are the softest shirts ever! I've had gildan under-shirts before, but these feel like baby face cloths- like a shammy. SUPER SOFT. Best purchase I've made in a long time. They fit perfect, there are NO scratchy or itchy areas, and again- softest shirt i've ever owned of ANY kind. Has the softness of a shirt that you have owned for 10 years and washed 1,000 times- but isn't all thin and worn out like those old shirts.. There was a $2 difference between these and some fruit of the loom or haynes ones, can't remember- i returned those cause they were SOOO scratchy. SOOO HAPPY I BOUGHT THESE INSTEAD!!!!!!

  I used to be a Hanes crew collar undershirt guy only, because they washed well and the collars stayed flat and didn’t droop! Well several years ago when Hanes changed their labels from black and red to only red, they changed their collars too, to a much less quality design. However these Gildan undershirts are of the quality of the old Hanes and they wash well, the collars stay flat and don’t droop! I even think these are a brighter white and stay whiter longer. And they are cheaper! I’m sold on Gildan now!

As promised I said I would update after six months or a year. The color has held up very well in the black shirts. In fact they’re only a shade or two lighter than they were a year before. And I wear these every single day for work underneath my work uniform. Very pleased with these! I highly recommend these shirts. You cannot go wrong for the price. And I was not paid for any of this.

  Completely satisfied with my shirts. Never had shirts from Gildan so I wasn’t sure what to expect, for quality. 6 T-Shirts for $11 is a deal. Shirts are soft and after the first wash I was expecting the shirts to shrink a lot. And once they came out the dryer shirts were just as soft when I first received them, they did shrink but it was minuscule. These shirts however do not conceal the nipples so if you are light skin with dark nipples you may want to wear an A-Shirt with this or wear this shirt as an undershirt. Overall definitely happy with my purchase and will buy more in the future.

  The initial fit of these shirts was as expected. Tag free neck is great. The packaging states that the shirts are made from ""premium soft cotton for all day comfort,"" but these are some of the roughest feeling T-shirts I have ever worn. They are not ""moisture-wicking"" (or maybe I don't know what this means) because after a light workout, the shirt looks like I've run a marathon, which never happens with my other T-shirts. After the first wash (machine-wash cold and tumble dry medium as stated by the instructions), the shirts all shrunk by 1-1.5 inches, but only lengthwise. I am worried to wash them again, otherwise I may end up with a midriff-baring crop top (Note: I am a male, and this look would not suit me very well). I can try and update this post if possible after my next wash, for those that are interested. Overall, I would recommend a different purchase if you are in the market to replace your current comfortable T-shirts

I typically do not put T-shirts in the dryer, but was curious as to the amount of shrinkage, I'll be letting these hang/air dry going forward, and will not be using the dryer for the other Gildan shirts we've got coming.

  I went to buy some more T shirts and was shocked at the prices! My wife had always resupplied me at Christmas so I had no concept of price. Searched and these popped up as Amazon's choice. They're great, just the right weight, they fit well, and the neck is tough enough not to stretch out. I paid good money for some Hanes that never recovered after the first wash; these are holding up great.<br/>Edit after 6 washings: The sleeves are a little short, which I like but others may prefer sleeves a little longer. They shrink slightly when machine dried so if you're between a large and x-large go with the XL unless you like them snug. Still very happy with them.

T-shirts are almost always too short in length for me.  This shirt has ample length.  Very surprising and very appreciated.

  Well made, and washes well. No real fading over time. I avoid bleach or the pool to prevent discoloring. Have been using Gildan T-shirts for years with no complaints.

  These t-shirts are ok, but not at all what I wanted. I spent way too much time shopping for these t-shirts (and reading the reviews posted for these and several others) for them to be as bad as they are. Don't get me wrong, they're fine for just plain undershirts if all you want is something to protect nicer shirts from pit-stains, but that's not how they're marketed, hence the 2-stars. I wanted t-shirts that were specifically a bit sturdier, especially around the collar, to prevent bacon-necking, as I wear them under a uniform. They have to look nice, and the neck had to stay firm. These do not even come close. I would give them 1-star in that regard, but as I said, they're ok as plain undershirts, so I have them 2-stars.

I would not get these if I was looking for a relaxed fitting undershirt or if you have a bigger belly (which I used to have).

  Excellent T Shirts.  I know many said they shrink, so I ordered a size larger than needed and after washing and drying on high heat, they are exactly the size I needed.  Also, shrinking thickens the cloth some so they are a good thickness also.  The seams were well sewed with no holes and no loose threads.  I may have just gotten lucky, but I am happier with these than the Hanes T Shirts and especially the Fruit of the Loom T Shirts I bought in recent years.  Mileage may vary, but from my experience, I highly recommend given the cavieat of buying a size large.

  It's often hit or miss on mens undershirts. I usually buy Hanes, but quality is all over the place. T shirts are dirt cheap and no need for dingy looking ones. I've had different Gildan shirts before and quality is usually above the rest, so gave them shot for some plain white T's. I ordered a size up and ran them thru the wash. I wanted a lighter weight T shirt for summer with a loose fit. Shirt fits perfect after wash, nice and soft. They shrunk, but only on the first wash with no further shrinkage going forward. Shirt also has a really nice neck that looks good throughout the day. Anyway, I liked these so much I immediately ordered another pack for backup. I tried the Gildan Crew T Multipack in black and grey (sized up). They were great also and I immediately order another pack of those.

  So, a few things to keep in mind when buying shirts. Whether you're going to buy them to wear on the outside/as a stand alone shirt OR your buying to wear under a uniform (i.e. security, law enforcement, firefighter, etc.).<br/><br/>If you're using them as a stand alone shirt, you can get whatever size you normally wear and it should fit you fine.<br/><br/>If you need them to wear under your uniform, get a size smaller and it won't be so small that it won't fit.  It'll just be snug enough so it doesn't bunch up under your uniform blouse once it's tucked in.<br/><br/>The quality seems great! Solid shirt and you can tell they used good quality material.

  Hard to complain about shirts this cheap. They get the job done. Colors are as represented, dark/saturated with no bleeding in wash.<br/><br/>However a few issues: 1) The stitching is not great. One of the five has a few areas of stitching hanging loose and incomplete. The rest seemed fine.  2) The sleeves are way too wide (for my taste I suppose), a bit short and almost flared out ... If you are under 6' and can do a 100 lb bicep curl with each arm, then the Medium probably will fit nicely.<br/><br/>As an undershirt, it's a solid buy. Just donate the one or two with bad stitching, and don't worry about the aesthetics. If you want to wear it on its own, I would probably look elsewhere.

  Why these are better thanks Hanes comfort soft and front of the loom:<br/>1.) the new fits tight it does not give that look of a stretched out neck sloppy undershirt look like all those do!!!!<br/>2.) 100% cotton and soft but they are not too thin nor too thick like comfort soft.<br/>They are most comparable to a Hanes tag less normal white t but the neck is soo much better.<br/>Super soft Cotton and perfect thickness.<br/>3.) perfect year round t but it is probably the best hot summer undershirt I’ve worn.

  WOW. Actually shocked by the quality of these. I bought a pack for tie dye, expecting them to be kinda cheap and flimsy....was not expecting them to be as soft, comfy, stretchy and well made as they were! It's always  been literally impossible  to find a decent white Tshirt, usually they're too stiff or see-through or they have an awfully awkward fit but not these! I bought a large for 6 different body types (my family all varies in shapes and size) and got raving reviews from everyone. Absolutely  did not expect to be blown away by these but so grateful this worked out so well.

  I wear t-shirts while I work outside most of the time. These are very comfortable, fit well, reasonably durable and exceptionally well-priced. This is the second 5-pack of these shirts I have bought over the past two years. They last as long as would be expected, but again, at this price, I'm not concerned about whether they last 2 or 5 years. I think they last a couple of years, each shirt worn about once a week (remember there are 5 shirts in the pack). Get these if you need some good work t-shirts and want to conserve your money.

  i bought these shirts for my husband. He is a long bodied 6'1 and 230lb man. He loves these shirts. They are soft and comfortable. He doesnt like his shirts to be too short in the back and these shirts are the perfect length going well below the belt/waistline.  I think he could probably fit better into a XL but because the shirts are 100% cotton, I bought the next size up to leave room for shrinkage.  I will try to remember to come back to update this review after the first wash.<br/><br/>****UPDATE: First wash - not a whole lot of shrinkage and they are just as soft and comfortable if not more after the first wash!! Waaay worth the buy! Will be back for more in different colors soon!

  In the past few months I've bought inexpensive t-shirts from Fruit of the loom, Hanes and Gildan. All through Amazon.  My reason in each case was the price per shirt.  They are all usable with none of the workmanship problems others have noticed.  I learned my lesson with the Fruit of the loom and ordered the extra large of each. They all shrunk to some degree and fit fine after being washed  (COOL water).  The Gildans are the best of the bunch. Nicer fabric, better collars and hems.  Will buy more of these when needed.

Better than Fruit of the Loom, but I wish I can find a brand that had longer sleeves at this price.<br/>Update: I ordered large to see if there is more room in the chest and arm pits.

  For the price these t-shirts are a pretty decent product.  I bought some Hanes t-shirts at the same time and I would rate them better for comfort.  Slightly thicker without being uncomfortable under a shirt or sweater.<br/>They are quite well made but on 4 of the 5 the seam under the sleeve was not finished very well.  As it was only on the inside I am not too concerned. However, the fifth shirt the seam actually finished on the outside as a 2"" tag.  More funny than anything but QA could probably be tightened.<br/><br/>Oddly, one of the five has more polyester and is described as 'moisture wicking'.  It is actually a nice t-shirt but I think I would have been happy with all cotton.<br/><br/>I would buy again.

  Shirts are very soft and comfortable. Colors are great. This is what I was hoping for but at a better than expected price point. Gildan could improve their QC, like other purchasers have mentioned, one of my shirts has a hole. That’s not great but I can live with it. 5 comfortable t-shirts cost less than two of the buy-my-name t-shirts. The problem is that Gildan seems to know this and “good enough” seems to be their QC mantra. With that said, I would purchase again and have had two orders already.

  6/pack/Black/M<br/><br/>The black color is faded or dull, not a deep rich black. I commonly notice this with t shirts or undershirts. I dislike it, but, It's not enough to jeopardize my decision. It matches the Gildan boxer brief.<br/><br/>The fit is okay. It was difficult knowing if they were considered undershirts or t shirts. Undershirts usually fit smaller and have smaller sleeves that I dislike. I consider this to be undershirts, however, versatile enough as a t shirt. So, I am satisfied.<br/><br/>I can wear a S or M for most shirts. I chose M for these to avoid a possible return. Because I had a feeling they fit more of a undershirt. That was a good decision so far. I have not washed them, though. So, I can't comment about shrinkage. There is enough length to tuck into pants and not show stomach.  The sleeves are shorter than I like. However, getting a larger size for a chance of longer sleeves risks the overall size. So, I will cooperate.<br/><br/>The neck is not favorable. But, I dislike crew necks. I prefer v neck, polo or button. Although there is a v neck available, lots of v neck undershirts have very deep ""v's"" exposing too much chest and the sleeves are short. So, I did not want to risk trying the v neck.<br/><br/>So far I am satisfied. I have had better, but, these are good value.

  Gildan is my go to brand for shirts now. They are comfortable &amp; affordable &amp; fit me pretty well. Originally I got them in an XL size(which felt more like a 2XL) so I went with the large which fits me much better. I love the black &amp; dark grey shirts but I’m not so crazy about the light grey ones. I would have much rather have traded them for one more dark grey &amp; one more black shirt had they had that option.

  These shirts are great! Very comfortable &amp; soft. Not rubbing on the skin. And it is very affordable. Way better than some other brands that I tried. I usually use them as undershirts, but one can wear it as a regular t-shirt too.<br/>The size does shrink a tiny bit after wash, but it fits very well, and it's almost indistinguishable in size between a brand new shirt and several times washed ones.<br/>Highly recommended

  So I began working full time in sales and I was constantly needing to wash my undershirts. I started looking for the least expensive shirts I could find since they were only going to be worn under my collared shirts. These were a great value as they hit all the marks on wjat I was looking for. These are lightweight, inexpensive and breathable. They are 100% cotton so expect some shrinkage (they fit a bit large initially, but fit me perfectly after they were washed).<br/>The material is very thin and there are a few defects so I would avoid wearing these by themselves unless you are doing something where you want to wear a shirt you don't mind ruining.

  These t-shirts feel really nice and fit perfectly, until after you wash them.  They will shrink a full and I mean, a full size smaller.  One other thing, the underside of the sleeves bunch, or feel like they are bunching up and a bit uncomfortable feeling.  I am returning them.  Before they were washed they fit great, so, if you plan on wearing them only once I could recommend them but if you wash them then be advised -- buy a size or two larger.

  Golden work shirts are typically a better fit. For whatever reason the sleeves on these were a little shorter than usual. Maybe it’s how I washed them. Overall good fit. I prefer a little looser fit but these worked out well. I’m not a fan of the super fitted so this is the perfect compromise. For size reference I’m short 5’8 and about 215lbs. Muscular build.

  I like crew necks and these are truly crew necks.  They maintain there shape even after a washing.  A few weeks prior, I had order a different brand that were supposed to have been crew necks.  They were not, and after 1 wash they lost there shape and were baggy and too loose around the neck; so, I sent them back...stating that they were not crew necks as I had ordered.  I now have warn and washed these t-shirts several times and they have held up there shape and the fit is still right.

I'm 6'1 200lbs and have a large upper frame(back and shoulders) with a standard torso(not chubby, not a 6 pack) and they're great fitting. They hug the right places but loose in the underarm area which is always my issue due to wide surface area of back and shoulders (I have a 17.5 inch neck) former athlete.

  These t-shirts are longer than any I've worn from other manufacturers.  They are at the least 6"" longer and remain long after washing.  My only suggestion is that they produce their boxer-briefs using the same colors.  Greys don't match, reds don't either.  The only ones that match are in black.  I also would like additional colors, Blue, Green.  If you are purchasing their boxer-briefs, as well, note that they are just the opposite.  They are extremely short from the crotch to the waistband.

  Buying shirts that fit me has always been a challenge because some manufacturers seem to deviate from traditional 2xl and 3xl U.S.A. sizes.

  The price was so cheap, it feels like I robbed the bank and got away with it!  These shirts are quite nice and feel every bit as good as anything you'd buy at the store.  Nice color combo (the charcoal gray color was unexpectedly cool).  I washed them on cool and dried them on low and didn't have any noticeable shrinking compared to a brand new shirt that had not yet been worn - I did this just to ensure an accurate way to measure for shrinkage.  Great shirts.  I'm going to buy at least another round of them.  At this price, you'd be nuts not to stock up.  Going to get some white ones, too.

  Good T shirts and a good price, I recommend them.  They do shrink up quite a bit on the first wash and dry, so size accordingly.  I bought mediums which fit fine until the first wash and dry, then they were tight, so I ordered more in large size. I will keep the mediums as I am trying to lose weight so they will fit better then.<br/>Oh I dont like how they package them, they are tightly rolled up and taped, hard to get tape off and they come extremely wrinkled.

The size is perfect out of the package until I wash them, then they are  just a little smaller, but it's still better than all other T-shirts when it comes to shrinking. If they made this same T-shirt a little bit longer so they wouldn't come untucked when I move around, i would like them even more. I am very active at my job, so reaching to upper shelves and running around is always a thing, and every time I reach for something, I feel my t-shirts come untucked just a little bit. .

I wash all my clothes in cold water and hang dry them so no hot water or dryer to shrink them.  These are nothing like the 5.3 oz. Heavy Cotton Adult T-Shirt Gildan made.  I ordered those 2 years ago and (the ones I haven’t stained or ripped) are still going strong and haven’t shrunk or stretched a bit.

  I washed the pack of shirts when I first got them and I have not been able to get the wrinkles out of them since. I have even ironed one of them and even with generous ironing it still had some creases in it. These shirts hold wrinkles really badly I have some wrinkle guard I will use on them but really for a $15 pack of shirts they are not worth it. They are soft enough and comfortable but you can tell it is a short lived shirt and the fabric might as well be made out of wrinkles. So ugly to wear I would just toss them in the trash but I will use them for a night tshirt.

See pics, the Jockey brand is an extra large just like the Gildan, Gildan is longer by 2 inches and sleeves about an inch longer. Since these are 100% cotton, I will let my cleaners starch them because cleaners will only starch 100% cotton. This will keep them longer. I ordered the 6 pack so if I don’t get them too dirty I can wear each one 2 times before washing them by tag instructions to last longer.

  Hopefully these continue to shrink as they are quite a bit too large on me now.  I bought these for something comfortable to wear while working from home.

  I apologize for my previous recommendation. This was made without consideration for use of the product over time. As soft as the shirts are, many developed large holes inside of 2-months of use. They are now used for polishing clothes for my cars. By contrast my much more expensive Jockeys have lasts for years. My take is the cotton is not wound nearly as tight as the Jockeys.<br/><br/>Used Jockey all my life, but they are expensive. This pack was a bargain for sure, but  they run a little small (mainly because of my excessive paunch) . Will stick with the product but will order XXL instead of XL next time.

  My husband started wearing Gildan T-shirts a few years ago, and very quickly became his favorite brand. The workmanship is top notch, the cotton material is of a better quality than others on the market. After numerous washes, they do not stretch out of shape, nor does the fabric break down. The fit is right-on, and he tells me how comfortable and cool they are (especially in our hot southern summers). It's also a nice layer during the winter. I can't praise Gildan enough.<br/>For your money, and quality - Gildan is the best!

  My fiance is tall and skinny. Ridiculously hard to shop for regarding shirts because his size is usually too short, or the right length is too big. We got him a size Large (6'6"" and a lean 200lbs) and it was a little baggy in the body area but comfortably baggy, not sloppy. They are athletic fit and I expect them to shrink a bit in the wash, which would make them fit perfectly. They fit his arms VERY well. I gave them to him as an early Christmas gift and he was grateful, because packs of plain black tshirts are impossible to find in stores anymore.

  I'm not stoked that this pack includes different materials. It's my fault that I didn't check, but 3 of them shrunk at least a full size, while the others didn't shrink at all. Deal breaker!

Cotton - Expect Shrinkage - Would Prefer They Were Longer To Compensate

<span>
  Always expect some shrinkage with cotton and especially in the length of the torso and sleeves. I want Large, so I order XL in cotton - standard protocol. However, the fit would be much better for me (and for most men, I would think) if they made them longer, so that when they shrink (and they always do), they would not end up with that boxy square shape. And they would be long enough to tuck in when I want (gasp). Sure, nobody wants them too long, but with the inevitable shrinking, that's not going to be a problem. Just a couple more inches is all (insert Michael Scott line here).

  WONDERFUL shirts.  I've spent 40 years hating undershirts.  Expensive ones were too thick and uncomfortable when tucked in, but cheap ones typically got stinky quickly, had necks that got stretched and sloppy after a few washes, and would never stay tucked in.  Finally I found these Gildans. These have a very well-made neck that's not too loose or sloppy looking, even after many wears and washes. The shirt is also an ideal weight for wearing under dress shirts and sweaters and is long enough to stay tucked in... for years I bought undershirts that were too big just so they would not come untucked, but not anymore.  And the price is incredible.  I've purchased the white and the assorted colored shirts, and all have been great.

  Their sizing chart is pretty accurate if you pay attention to it.

  As I do with all new clothing before I wear it I washed these shirts and unfortunately the one shirt (red one) developed a hole in this first wash.  I did not use bleach or other products that could cause this to happen. I followed the label directions exactly.  Since it was washed I could not return it.  Still a good deal for the number of wearable shirts I got.

  I've been buying tshirts from Gildan for over ten years now. You get solid durable quality at an affordable price and I would recommend them to anyone. I have never received a defective shirt in the hundreds I've purchased over the years. I would personally go a size higher than you're used to; I typically wear a medium but find a large Gildan tshirt to fit better.

  Gildan tshirts are the worst. I bought some solid colors, and they fell apart after several washes. I thought I would give them one more try with solid white. Nope, the same thing happened after the first wash. Check out the pic and buyer beware. What is happening to clothes in the US? Jean's don't fit anymore with thinner material. Shoes fall apart after a few months. And now my tshirts are worthless. And don't get me started on underwear. I think I'm going to cancel my prime account. Sorry Bezos.

  My son needed a bunch of workout shirts for wrestling practice.  Despite the other bad reviews, the shirts are soft, durable,<br/>and well stitched. No issues with the material being too light or see through (someone else mentioned it). It’s cotton, it’s going to shrink slightly so plan accordingly especially if you dry on high heat.  No noticeable issues after I’ve washed them and dried them.

  I’m not sure when plain white t’s became so expensive but they are a bit over priced at places like Target, Kohl’s etc.  These shirts were a better value to me and had good reviews.  I am familiar with this brand since I used to own a screen printing business.  They have quality products which made my decision a little easier.  Initially when I opened the package I thought these shirts were going to be too heavy as an undershirt so I was a little disappointed. But, once I washed them they softened up so I decided to wear one as a test.  I am now completely satisfied with these shirts and will likely buy another pack.

  For some reason, I can only wear and wash white t-shirts a small number of times or so before they are noticeably yellowed.  It's probably a combo of my sweat and the very hard water here.  Bleaching doesn't help much, so for me, white undershirts are somewhat disposable. I wear them until I retire them to dirty work or rag duty. These are a perfect cross of price and quality for my needs. As for fabric weight, I'd say it's medium-light.

  I don’t typically write reviews.<br/>But feel compelled as this is a horrible quality product.<br/>I don’t know where they sourced the cotton on this. But it gets worse wash after wash.<br/>The Denier, or density of thread  - a unit of measure for the linear mass density of fibers.<br/>In simple terms level of quality.  Think 400 thread count sheets vs. 1500.<br/><br/>I wouldn’t use these T-Shirts even as rags in my garage as they will scratch what ever I wipe with it.<br/><br/>The collar materials is even worse.  They actually created rub/skin tags on my neck.  And yes. I use Name brand Laundry Detergent (Persil) and Fabric Softener (Downy) on a Front load washing machine.<br/><br/>I decided to try these instead of my go to “Kirkland Signature” brand. What an unfortunate experiment.<br/>The Kirkland held together for longer than expected, didn’t pit, and didn’t get holes.  The more I washed, the softer they became.<br/><br/>If you have skin of steel and $10 bucks to waste.  Go for it.

You can get tons of white ones but no packs of just plain black tees.” Well I have and I couldn’t just sit back and watch the world go by, so I set out on a mission! I got ready, put my shoes and jacket on grabbed my phone and walked out the door. I turned right back around and went inside because Amazon is an app on my phone. Typed in “black tee shirt bulk” and these suckers popped up. Well I hit buy now instead of add to cart as I was nervous this was a once in a lifetime moment to get what I finally wanted. I read other reviews and them people are schleps. These shirts are great! I love the plain black design with the arm holes and the hole I put my head thru. It was a pleasant surprise that they are in fact, black tee shirts. 26 stars if possible. Only downside is I look silly with all 6 on at one time but I’m still growing so I’m sure it’ll be perfect soon!

  I'm not exactly the most fit kind of guy, so I typically but the large for that extra bit of belly space.  However, with these shirts the large fits me exceedingly loose.  I switched to medium and am very happy with the fit.

  I bought both of my adult sons a package of these TShirts because they were a good price and they wear TShirts to work and casually. These are definitely thinner than typical TShirts but they fit as expected and my sons are fine with them. They did say that the shirts will probably end up ripped or lose shape after several washings because of how thin they are but, for the low price, they were worth buying. I paid about $10.00 for each package of five.

  I don't leave many reviews on products, especially bad ones, but I feel morally obligated to warn people about these shirts. They are terrible. If they're actually made from cotton as they claim, it must have been from the absolutely worst part of the cotton plant (or maybe the dirt they were planted in?). I ordered two sets and decided to risk washing one of them to see if they would soften up. They didn't. They literally feel like sandpaper. If you're someone who has sensitive skin issues (eczema, dermatitis, allergies, or whatever) and are looking for an inexpensive cotton shirt, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE.

  Undershirts are undershirts.  They're not made to look cool, but to prevent your good shirts from getting dirty.  As such they're okay.<br/><br/>One thing I wish was different about these shirts, was that the neck on them was wider than a normal shirt, and the sleves slightly shorter than a normal shirt, so that you wouldn't be able to see a bit of the white undershirt when I wear other shirts.  Aside from that, these are okay.

I wanted to replace my large aging collection with some new crisp white tshirts.  Being able to buy 10 at a time (I bought a total of 20) to replace them all sure made my wife happy! They fit well... I did buy XXL so with a little shirking in the dryer, they're a perfect XL fit. The quality and construction is on par with Hanes or any others I've had before.  They seem thick enough to even wear on their own too.

  The t-shirts fit nice. They feel nice. After I washed them in cold water and dried on low heat they shrunk so much it looks like I borrowed clothes from a child. Ridiculous how much they shrunk when they fit so nice prior to being washed. So if anyone wants clothes for a kid, let me know. But until I get new t-shirts for work I’ll just look like I’m selling myself of 1st Street. Not a nice look for a captain.

  I am 5' 11"", athletic and muscular.  The shoulders and the arms fit great but the shirts are cut way too long.  A properly cut t-shirt should be cut at mid-fly and these are cut at crotch level and look extremely sloppy when worn untucked.  The fit around the abdominal area is a bit too generous as well.  Would not be a problem if you tuck your t-shirts in but I do not.  I guess these are made for people that are closer to seven feet tall with a bit of a gut.  I guess you get what you pay for.

  This was the first time I bought a Gildan product.<br/>The product was delivered before the given delivery date (a plus). I opened the package and tried on a T-shirt for fit and it felt great, just right - length, shoulders, armpit, etc. So, I put the T's in the washer (cold) with other similar colors, normal wash and dry process. When I removed from the dryer to fold they looked significantly smaller so I tried one on. They don't fit anymore! They shrunk so much they are not long enough to tuck in my pants and are very tight around the armpit stitch. Unwearable! Please be forewarned: if you buy this product make sure you order at one or two sizes larger. I would recommend going with Hanes, Fruit or another brand.

Most brands do 2x as if they are for overweight people, not for big people who are fit. These are perfect if your waist is smaller than your shoulders.<br/><br/>Overweight people may want to order these big so the waist area fits better.<br/><br/>I like these so much I'm about to order another set of 6.

  When you order these t-shirts just know that they will shrink. So it's best to order one size larger than what you really need. I normally wear large t-shirt but after reading the reviews I ordered an extra large to account for the shrinkage. When I took them out of the package I thought the XL size was actually a dress. After I put them in the washing machine then they shrunk to a large and I'm okay with that.

  Walmart quit carrying the Gildan crew neck shirts so I had to resort to buying them on-line. Gildan as ALWAYS been my favorite as the sleeves are a perfect fit (not too long or short) and they aren't overly thin/see through like other brands. . Gildan has been perfect. Although the one's I ordered online were longer (body of the shirt) than typical. More like the length of an actual t-shirt (if not longer) rather than an undershirt. But I can't complain. They are great to wear around the house, doing yard work, painting, work out in, etc and priced to where you can just throw them away when they get stained.

  I have been buying these shirts for 3 years and have not ran into any problems that other people are having. My shirts do not have any holes in them or stains on them and they fit great. I would suggest buying a size up if you want more of a regular fit but if you are looking for a slim fit then I would buy your size. These shrink almost an entire size in the washer and dryer but these shirts are amazing. I have been buying them for years and will continue to buy them. Only shirts that actually have a good fit that I’ve bought so far. Thank yku Gildan!

  I'm 5'9"" 165 lbs and wear a medium. My biggest issue with undershirts from Hanes and Fruit of the Loom is they have a collar you could drive a truck through. Me personally I like a tighter fitting collar and the Gildan's are better than others I've tried. However, as with other similar undershirts, these shrink a lot and now some of them do not stay tucked in. The quality is on par with Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and other undershirts I've tried but at least it somewhat solves my collar issue.

  i prefer a fitted t-shirt that is soft and comfortable. these are not comfortable, soft or fitted. because they're 100% cotton after they're washed they look crinkled and there's no way i'm ironing a t-shirt. maybe as an undershirt, these would be ok. these t-shirts are donated to the goodwill.

  I like this company. Great price for good quality, relatively thick compared to other brands,100% cotton shirts. These work as undershirts or for going out. Recently I've gained weight because I been stuck inside and had to go up a size so I bought all new undergarments like boxer briefs, the white version of this shirt, and this (the black one) and all of them are great I wear them preferentially.

  Long story short, these are decent quality everday wear undershirts.  My chest size is 41-42"" but I like a tight fit so that there are no wrinkles underneath my dress shirts.

  I am not even convinced that these are authentic, I have never had shirts fall apart so quickly. After literally one wash cycle (with the washer set to sensitive) every single stitch lining the bottom of the shirts came out. This was not just one bad shirt, as every one in the pack had the same issue. Only buy these if you are looking for single wear shirts, or maybe non-absorbent dish cloths. Better yet, don't buy them at all. Light the money on fire instead.

Fatty likes his shirts a little loose.  Got the 2XL and fit nice.  Even after a little shrinking, they should still be fitting nice.  Colors are nice and can’t beat the price.

  These are honestly the greatest shirts I own but I just don’t like the fact that they shrink. They shrink a good amount as well. Out of the box shirt length is long, pass the belt line and usually after the first wash and dry they shrink and sit right above the belt line.

After washing these tee shirts and putting through a normal dryer cycle, I did not find shrinkage to be a problem.  The one key element of the is tee shirt is that the collar lays flat.  This allows for a good look under a work shirt. I am pleased with how the collar lays.  It looks good.

  These are some nice quality shirts.

  Received my order of these shirts and tried one on. The fit was somewhat snug, though that is how I generally like my t-shirt to fit. Washed them following the care instructions before wearing and they shrunk terribly. Not the usual first-time-washed shrinkage. No. I'm talking down two sizes shrinkage. Sleeves turned into cap sleeves they were so short, and the shirt itself didn't even reach my belt line. Really disappointed with how this turned out because I can't even return them since they've been washed.<br/><br/>Buy a size larger than usual, at least, if you're purchasing some of these.

  This T-shirt is good for men and women. It is a high quality shirt with great great stitching in all the important areas like hem, underarm, neckband. No tag yay and keep you cool. I love my T-shirts and recommend them for everyone.

  These shirts shrink up faster than George Costanza in a pool. The length right out of the bag was below the belt but after one wash they shrink right up and now I can barely tuck it in. Unfortunately this causes my dress shirt to look bunched up at the bottom when the white undershirt works it’s way up. I’m 6’2’ and 195 and bought the large but maybe I should have gone with the extra large. I’ll probably just look else where for a slim fit tall shirt.

  For $10 for a 6-pack, I half expected these t-shirts to be too short, too small and stitched together badly. None of that is the case. They're decently long and actually too big in the midsection to fit me well as an undershirt. As usual, I'd prefer a slightly looser neckband. If you're delicate, be aware that the material is not nearly as smooth as t-shirts that cost 3X the price. Overall, good for the price. I'll probably buy a pack of size L to wear under dress shirts.

  For less than three dollars per shirt it might even be cost effective to use them as spill mops. The quality and colors are much better than I expected. Great for wearing under my quarter zips for an extra layer. The poor reviews on these shirts begs the question; What do you want for nothing?<br/>I will re-post if they dissolve after washing.

  This is not an undershirt as they are WAY too short. I am only 5’8” and these don’t stay tucked at all. The arm holes fit better than Jerzees and Fruit of the Loom.

Everything I needed from an undershirt
","<span class=""a-size-base review-text review-text-content"" data-hook=""review-body"">
<span>
  These were everything I needed out of a pack of under shirts. They're soft, fit is right, not too big not too tight, the fabric doesn't feel cheap and thin (unlike my white fruit of the loom shirts that unfortunately tend to stretch out and droop when I wear them) but it isn't thick and stiff like the pro weight brand, it is right in the middle on how you want a lightweight t shirt to feel. These actually feel sturdy enough to wear as a regular outer t shirt.

  I was unimpressed, even a bit disappointed.<br/>The Ts are lightweight and thin. The neck seemed to stretch out as the day went on. While I didn't return them I will not be buying more. I thought from the positive reviews they would be of better quality than the F of the L type T-shirt. They aren't any better but about the same and that isn't good enough.

  Looks like the picture. Quality is good and fits perfectly. Totally expected this out of Gildan clothes. Have been using Gildan for a long time now and I trust their quality. Never had a complaint about their quality. The only down part about this is the shirt is a little thinner and hence doesn’t retain a lot of heat. But this would be a great Tshirt for summer use rather than winter

  I washed one time with cold water, Tide, and normal wash. Dried on extra low heat (I dry everything on extra low). I ordered like 10 of them and they all shrunk horizontally so bad (probably 4-5 inches) that they would not stay tucked and I was uncomfortable in them. I had to return them. Weird thing was they didn't shrink vertically. They just lost too much heighth so it's not like buying two sizes too big and letting them shrink would even be feasible.
