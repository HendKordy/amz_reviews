Waste of money. This is the third time purchasing - the first time the shirts I received shrunk to a normal size and lasted forever, thicker, better - they were great, second batch shrunk immediately, third, I hoped for the best, only to be disappointed. I should be able to return them.\\n</span>\\n</span>  \n",

Holds it shape wash after wash, I throw in regular wash and hot dryer and comes out beautiful every time, no fading and no loss of the perfect shape!!!

If I didn't already have black dye on hand then I'd be returning them. Not worth the hassle to return them when I've already have other clothing that needs dyed black. Expected a little more from Gildan. Been buying from them for years. Used to be good quality.\\n</span>\\n</span>  \n",

They are also long. I thought they would be regular length but these are for tall people lol. The price was good though, so I'll keep these for around the house or to sleep in.\\n</span>\\n</span>  \n",

It looks good on him, all I will say is if you are expecting this T-shirt to be a thick material like the classic (Pro Club T-Shirts) it is not. The material isn't like extremely thin, but again it is not a thick T-shirt, still a great product though, good to wear around spring and summer.\\n</span>\\n</span>  \n",
